    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even in college Alfred Hardy was a young man of fixed ideas and high
      ideals and proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend, Jimmy Jinks, had few ideas and no ideals, and was glad of it,
      and before half of their first college term had passed, Jimmy had ridded
      himself of all such worries as making up his own mind or directing his own
      morals. Alfred did all these things so much better, argued Jimmy,
      furthermore, Alfred LIKED to do them&mdash;Jimmy owed it to his friend to
      give him that pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Jimmy was several years Alfred's senior and twice his size,
      in no way altered his opinion of Alfred's judgment, and through their
      entire college course they agreed as one man in all their discussions&mdash;or
      rather&mdash;in all Alfred's discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not until the close of their senior year that Alfred favoured
      Jimmy with his views on matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting alone in a secluded corner of the campus waiting for Alfred to
      solve a problem in higher mathematics, Jimmy now recalled fragments of
      Alfred's last conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No twelve dollar shoes and forty dollar hats for MY wife,&rdquo; his young
      friend had raged and he condemned to Jimmy the wicked extravagance of his
      own younger sisters. &ldquo;The woman who gets me must be a home-maker. I'll
      take her to the theatre occasionally, and now and then we'll have a few
      friends in for the evening; but the fireside must be her magnet, and I'll
      be right by her side each night with my books and my day's worries. She
      shall be taken into my confidence completely; and I'll take good care to
      let her know, before I marry her, just what I expect in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred certainly has the right idea about marriage,&rdquo; mused Jimmy, as the
      toe of his boot shoved the gravel up and down the path. &ldquo;There's just one
      impractical feature about it.&rdquo; He was conscious of a slight feeling of
      heresy when he admitted even ONE flaw in his friend's scheme of things.
      &ldquo;Where is Alfred to find such a wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy ran through the list of unattached girls to whom Alfred had thus far
      presented him. It was no doubt due to his lack of imagination, but try as
      he would, he could not see any one of these girls sitting by the fireside
      listening to Alfred's &ldquo;worries&rdquo; for four or five nights each week. He
      recalled all the married women whom he had been obliged, through no fault
      of his own, to observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, all of them did not boast twelve dollar shoes or forty dollar hats&mdash;for
      the very simple reason that the incomes or the tempers of their husbands
      did not permit of it. In any case, Jimmy did not remember having seen them
      spend many evenings by the fireside. Where then was Alfred to find the
      exceptional creature who was to help &ldquo;systematise his life&rdquo;? Jimmy was not
      above hoping that Alfred's search might be a long one. He was content for
      his friend to go jogging along by his side, theorising about marriage and
      taking no chances with facts. Having come to this conclusion, he began to
      feel uneasy at Alfred's non-appearance. Alfred had promised to meet him on
      this spot at four-thirty, and Alfred had decided ideas about punctuality.
      It was now five-thirty. Ought Jimmy to look for him, or would he be wiser
      to remain comfortably seated and to try to digest another of his friend's
      theories?
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jimmy was trying to decide this vexed question, his ear caught the
      sound of a girlish titter. Turning in embarrassment toward a secluded path
      just behind him, whom did he see coming toward him but Alfred, with what
      appeared to be a bunch of daffodils; but as Alfred drew nearer, Jimmy
      began to perceive at his elbow a large flower-trimmed hat, and&mdash;&ldquo;horrors!&rdquo;&mdash;beneath
      it, with a great deal of filmy white and yellow floating from it, was a
      small pink and white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barely had Jimmy reversed himself and rearranged his round, astonished
      features, when Alfred, beaming and buoyant, brought the bundle of fluff to
      a full stop before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to be late, old chap,&rdquo; said Alfred. &ldquo;I have brought my excuse with
      me. I want you to know Miss Merton.&rdquo; Then turning to the small creature,
      whose head peeped just above his elbow, Alfred explained to her graciously
      that Jimmy Jinks was his very best friend, present company excepted, of
      course, and added that she and Jimmy would no doubt &ldquo;see a great deal of
      each other in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his embarrassment, Jimmy's eyes went straight to the young lady's
      shoes. It was possible that there might be more expensive shoes in this
      world, but Jimmy had certainly never seen daintier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we didn't disturb you,&rdquo; a small voice was chirping; and innocent
      and conventional as the remark surely was, Jimmy was certain of an
      undercurrent of mischief in it. He glanced up to protest, but two
      baby-blue eyes fixed upon him in apparent wonderment, made him certain
      that anything he could say would seem rude or ridiculous; so, as usual
      when in a plight, he looked to Alfred for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slapping Jimmy upon the shoulder in a condescending spirit, Alfred
      suggested that they all sit down and have a chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how nice,&rdquo; chirped the small person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy felt an irresistible desire to run, but the picture of himself, in
      his very stout person, streaking across the campus to the giggled delight
      of Miss Fluff, soon brought him submissively to the seat, where he sat
      twiddling his straw hat between his fingers, and glancing uncertainly at
      Alfred, who was thoughtful enough to sit next him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness, one could almost dance out here, couldn't one?&rdquo; said the small
      person, named Zoie, as her eyes roved over the bit of level green before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to try?&rdquo; asked Alfred, apparently agreeable to her every
      caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd love it!&rdquo; cried Zoie. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo; She sprang up and held out her
      hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be unselfish,&rdquo; answered Alfred, &ldquo;and let Jimmy have that
      fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Jimmy had been seized with an intuitive feeling that his
      friend was in immediate danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this the young woman who was to sit opposite the fireside five nights
      a week and systematise Alfred's life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy stared at the intruder blankly. For answer, two small hands were
      thrust out toward him and an impatient little voice was commanding him to
      &ldquo;Come, dance.&rdquo; He heard Alfred's laughter. He had no intention of
      accommodating the small person in this or any other matter, yet, before he
      realised quite how it had happened, he was two-stepping up and down the
      grass to her piping little voice; nor did she release him until the
      perspiration came rolling from his forehead; and, horror of horrors, his
      one-time friend, Alfred, seemed to find this amusing, and laughed louder
      and louder when Jimmy sank by his side exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jimmy was again able to think consecutively, he concluded that
      considerable conversation must have taken place between Alfred and the
      small one, while he was recovering his breath and re-adjusting his wilted
      neckwear. He was now thrown into a fresh panic by an exclamation from the
      excitable Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must both meet my friend, Aggie Darling,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;I am
      bringing her with me to the hop to-night. She is not at all like me. You
      will like her dreadfully.&rdquo; She smiled at Jimmy as though she were
      conferring a great favour upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like her dreadfully,&rdquo; commented Jimmy to himself. &ldquo;It was just the kind
      of expression one might expect from a mind in such disorder as hers.
      'Systematise Alfred's life,' indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was more nonsensical chatter, or so it seemed to Jimmy, then Zoie
      and Alfred rose to go, and Jimmy was told by both of them that he was to
      put in an appearance at the Fraternity &ldquo;hop&rdquo; that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see you at dinner,&rdquo; called Alfred gaily over his shoulder and Jimmy
      was left to grapple with his first disappointment at his friend's lack of
      discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's her fault,&rdquo; concluded Jimmy, as he lifted himself heavily off the
      bench and started down the campus, resolved to console himself with food.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now Jimmy had no intention of going to the &ldquo;hop.&rdquo; He had tried to tell
      Alfred so a dozen times during dinner, but each time he had been
      interrupted by one of Alfred's enthusiastic rhapsodies about Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most marvellous girl I have ever met!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred over his soup.
      &ldquo;So sensible; so modest. And did you see how simply she dresses?&rdquo; he
      asked. Jimmy recalled his first vision of billowy fluff; but before he
      could answer, Alfred had continued excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what first attracted me toward her.&rdquo; He looked at Jimmy as
      though he expected some especial mark of gratitude for the favour about to
      be bestowed; then he explained with a serious weighing of his words, &ldquo;It
      was her love of children. I had barely been introduced to her when she
      turned her back upon me and gave her whole attention to Professor Peck's
      little boy Willie. I said to myself, 'any girl of that age who prefers
      children to young chaps of my age, is the girl for me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; assented Jimmy lamely. It was his first remark during dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that, I no longer hesitated. You know, Jimmy, I have decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have noticed,&rdquo; admitted Jimmy, without conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fifteen minutes,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;I had learned all about the young
      lady's antecedents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having finished his soup, and resisted a childish impulse to tip the plate
      and scrape the bottom of it, Jimmy was now looking anxiously toward the
      door through which the roast ought to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you all about her,&rdquo; volunteered Alfred. But Jimmy's eyes were
      upon Alfred's plate; his friend had not yet devoured more than two
      spoonfuls of soup; at that rate, argued Jimmy, the roast would reach them
      about the time that he was usually trying to make his dessert last as long
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is here with her aunt,&rdquo; continued Alfred. &ldquo;They are on a short visit
      to Professor Peck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy approved of the &ldquo;short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; he murmured, hopeful that a separation from the minx might
      restore his friend's reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jimmy,&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred with glistening eyes, &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy thought a great deal but he forebore to say it, and Alfred continued
      very enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lives right in the same town with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated Jimmy, and he felt his appetite going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within a stone's throw of my house&mdash;and yours,&rdquo; added Alfred
      triumphantly. &ldquo;Think of our never having met her before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she has been away from home a great deal,&rdquo; went on Alfred.
      &ldquo;She's been in school in the East; but there were the summers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there were,&rdquo; assented Jimmy, thinking of his hitherto narrow escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father is old John Merton,&rdquo; continued Alfred. &ldquo;Merton the stationer&mdash;you
      know him, Jimmy. Unfortunately, he has a great deal of money; but that
      hasn't spoilt her. Oh no! She is just as simple and considerate in her
      behaviour as if she were some poor little struggling school teacher. She
      is the one for me, Jimmy. There is no doubt about it, and I'll tell you a
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked at him blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to propose to her this very night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; groaned Jimmy, as if his friend had been suddenly struck down
      in the flower of his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why you simply must come with me to the hop,&rdquo; continued Alfred. &ldquo;I
      want you to take care of her friend Aggie, and leave me alone with Zoie as
      much as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoie!&rdquo; sniffed Jimmy. The name to him was as flippant as its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, strong name,&rdquo; commented Alfred. &ldquo;So simple, so direct, so like her.
      I'll have to leave you now,&rdquo; he said, rising. &ldquo;I must send her some
      flowers for the dance.&rdquo; He turned at the door. Suppose I add a few from
      you for Aggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exploded Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just by way of introduction,&rdquo; called Alfred gaily. &ldquo;It's a good idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Jimmy could protest further, he found himself alone for the second
      time that day. He ate his roast in gloomy silence. It seemed dry and
      tasteless. Even his favourite desert of plum pudding failed to rouse him
      from his dark meditations, and he rose from the table dejected and
      forlorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later, when Alfred led Jimmy into the ballroom, the latter was
      depressed, not only by his friend's impending danger, but he felt an
      uneasy foreboding as to his own future. With his college course
      practically finished and Alfred attaching himself to unforeseen entities,
      Jimmy had come to the ball with a curious feeling of having been left
      suspended in mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could voice his misgivings to Alfred, the young men were
      surrounded by a circle of chattering females. And then it was that Jimmy
      found himself looking into a pair of level brown eyes, and felt himself
      growing hot and cold by turns. When the little knot of youths and maidens
      disentangled itself into pairs of dancers, it became clear to Jimmy that
      he had been introduced to Aggie, and that he was expected to dance with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Jimmy had danced with many girls; true, it was
      usually when there was no other man left to &ldquo;do duty&rdquo;; but still he had
      done it. Why then should he feel such distressing hesitation about placing
      his arm around the waist of this brown-eyed Diana? Try as he would he
      could not find words to break the silence that had fallen between them.
      She was so imposing; so self-controlled. It really seemed to Jimmy that
      she should be the one to ask him to dance. As a matter of fact, that was
      just what happened; and after the dance she suggested that they sit in the
      garden; and in the garden, with the moonlight barely peeping through the
      friendly overhanging boughs of the trees, Jimmy found Aggie capable of a
      courage that filled him with amazement; and later that night, when he and
      Alfred exchanged confidences, it became apparent to the latter that Aggie
      had volunteered to undertake the responsibility of outlining Jimmy's
      entire future.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to follow his father's wishes and take up a business career in
      Chicago at once; and as soon as all the relatives concerned on both sides
      had been duly consulted, he and Aggie were to embark upon matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Alfred, when Jimmy had managed to stammer his shame-faced
      confession. &ldquo;We'll make it a double wedding. I can be ready to-morrow, so
      far as I'm concerned.&rdquo; And then followed another rhapsody upon the fitness
      of Zoie as the keeper of his future home and hearth, and the mother of his
      future sons and daughters. In fact, it was far into the night when the two
      friends separated&mdash;separated in more than one sense, as they
      afterward learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Alfred and Jimmy were saying &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; to each other, Zoie and
      Aggie in one of the pretty chintz bedrooms of Professor Peck's modest
      home, were still exchanging mutual confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing I like about Alfred,&rdquo; said Zoie, as she gazed at the tip of her
      dainty satin slipper, and turned her head meditatively to one side, &ldquo;is
      his positive nature. I've never before met any one like him. Do you know,&rdquo;
       she added with a sly twinkle in her eye, &ldquo;it was all I could do to keep
      from laughing at him. He's so awfully serious.&rdquo; She giggled to herself at
      the recollection of him; then she leaned forward to Aggie, her small hands
      clasped across her knees and her face dimpling with mischief. &ldquo;He hasn't
      the remotest idea what I'm like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie studied her young friend with unmistakable reproach. &ldquo;I MADE Jimmy
      know what I'M like,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I told him ALL my ideas about everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie in shocked surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's sure to find out sooner or later,&rdquo; said Aggie sagely. &ldquo;I think
      that's the only sensible way to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'd told Alfred all MY ideas about things,&rdquo; smiled Zoie, &ldquo;there'd have
      BEEN no beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Aggie, with a troubled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take our meeting,&rdquo; explained Zoie. &ldquo;Just as we were introduced,
      that horrid little Willie Peck caught his heel in a flounce of my skirt. I
      turned round to slap him, but I saw Alfred looking, so I patted his ugly
      little red curls instead. And what do you think? Alfred told me to-night
      that it was my devotion to Willie that first made him adore me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn't explain to him?&rdquo; asked Aggie in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lose him before I'd got him!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be better than losing him AFTER you've got him,&rdquo; concluded the
      elder girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aggie,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, &ldquo;I think you are horrid. You're just trying to
      spoil all the fun of my engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; cried Aggie, and the next moment she was sitting on the arm of
      Zoie's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goose!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how dare you be cross with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am NOT cross,&rdquo; declared Zoie, and after the customary apologies from
      Aggie, confidence was fully restored on both sides and Zoie continued
      gaily: &ldquo;Don't you worry about Alfred and me,&rdquo; she said as she kicked off
      her tiny slippers and hopped into bed. &ldquo;Just you wait until I get him.
      I'll manage him all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; answered Aggie; not without misgivings, as she turned off
      the light.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The double wedding of four of Chicago's &ldquo;Younger Set&rdquo; had been adequately
      noticed in the papers, the conventional &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; journey had been made,
      and Alfred Hardy and Jimmy Jinks had now settled down to the routine of
      their respective business interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having plunged into his office work with the same vigour with which he had
      attacked higher mathematics, Alfred had quickly gained the confidence of
      the elders of his firm, and they had already begun to give way to him in
      many important decisions. In fact, he was now practically at the head of
      his particular department with one office doing well in Chicago and a
      second office promising well in Detroit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jimmy, he had naturally started his business career with fewer
      pyrotechnics; but he was none the less contented. He seldom saw his old
      friend Alfred now, but Aggie kept more or less in touch with Zoie; and
      over the luncheon table the affairs of the two husbands were often
      discussed by their wives. It was after one of these luncheons that Aggie
      upset Jimmy's evening repose by the fireside by telling him that she was a
      wee bit worried about Zoie and Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred is so unreasonable,&rdquo; said Aggie, &ldquo;so peevish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy shortly. &ldquo;If he's peevish he has some good
      reason. You can be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't get cross with me, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Aggie in a hurt voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be cross with you?&rdquo; snapped Jimmy. &ldquo;It isn't YOUR fault if
      Alfred's made a fool of himself by marrying the last person on earth whom
      he should have married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he was very lucky to get her,&rdquo; argued Aggie in defence of her
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do, do you?&rdquo; answered Jimmy in a very aggrieved tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is one of the prettiest girls in Chicago,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're pretty too,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, &ldquo;but it doesn't make an idiot of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's TIME you said something nice to me,&rdquo; purred Aggie; and her arm stole
      fondly around Jimmy's large neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why it is,&rdquo; said Jimmy, shaking his head dejectedly, &ldquo;but
      every time Zoie Hardy's name is mentioned in this house it seems to stir
      up some sort of a row between you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's because you're so prejudiced,&rdquo; answered Aggie with a touch of
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go again,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean it!&rdquo; interposed Aggie contritely. &ldquo;Oh, come now, Jimmy,&rdquo;
       she pleaded, &ldquo;let's trundle off to bed and forget all about it.&rdquo; And they
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day, as Jimmy was heading for the La Salle restaurant to get
      his luncheon, who should call to him airily from a passing taxi but Zoie.
      It was apparent that she wished him to wait until she could alight; and in
      spite of his disinclination to do so, he not only waited but followed the
      taxi to its stopping place and helped the young woman to the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you darling!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, all of a flutter, and looking exactly
      like an animated doll. &ldquo;You've just saved my life.&rdquo; She called to the taxi
      driver to &ldquo;wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in trouble?&rdquo; asked the guileless Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dreadful,&rdquo; answered Zoie, and she thrust a half-dozen small parcels
      into Jimmy's arms. &ldquo;I have to be at my dressmaker's in half an hour; and I
      haven't had a bite of lunch. I'm miles and miles from home; and I can't go
      into a restaurant and eat just by myself without being stared at. Wasn't
      it lucky that I saw you when I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was really very little left for Jimmy to say, so he said it; and a
      few minutes later they were seated tete-a-tete in one of Chicago's most
      fashionable restaurants, and Zoie the unconscious flirt was looking up at
      Jimmy with apparently adoring eyes, and suggesting all the eatables which
      he particularly abominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the unfortunate man acquiesced in one thing and communicated
      Zoie's wish to the waiter, than the flighty young person found something
      else on the menu that she considered more tempting to her palate. Time and
      again the waiter had to be recalled and the order had to be given over
      until Jimmy felt himself laying up a store of nervous indigestion that
      would doubtless last him for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coveted food at last arrived, Zoie had become completely
      engrossed in the headgear of one of her neighbours, and it was only after
      Jimmy had been induced to make himself ridiculous by craning his neck to
      see things of no possible interest to him that Zoie at last gave her
      attention to her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In obeyance of Jimmy's order the waiter managed to rush the lunch through
      within three-quarters of an hour; but when Jimmy and Zoie at length rose
      to go he was so insanely irritated, that he declared they had been in the
      place for hours; demanded that the waiter hurry his bill; and then finally
      departed in high dudgeon without leaving the customary &ldquo;tip&rdquo; behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this was without its effect upon Zoie, who, a few moments later
      rode away in her taxi, waving gaily to Jimmy who was now late for business
      and thoroughly at odds with himself and the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of the time lost at luncheon Jimmy missed an appointment that
      had to wait over until after office hours, and as a result of this
      postponement, he missed Aggie, who went to a friend's house for dinner,
      leaving word for him to follow. For the first time in his life, Jimmy
      disobeyed Aggie's orders, and, later on, when he &ldquo;trundled off to bed&rdquo;
       alone, he again recalled that it was Zoie Hardy who was always causing
      hard feeling between him and his spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later, when Aggie reached home with misgivings because Jimmy
      had not joined her, she was surprised to find him sleeping as peacefully
      as a cherub. &ldquo;Poor dear,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I hope he wasn't lonesome.&rdquo; And
      she stole away to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning when Aggie did not appear at the breakfast table, Jimmy
      rushed to her room in genuine alarm. It was now Aggie's turn to sleep
      peacefully; and he stole dejectedly back to the dining-room and for the
      first time since their marriage, he munched his cold toast and sipped his
      coffee alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thoroughly was his life now disorganised, and so low were his spirits
      that he determined to walk to his office, relying upon the crisp morning
      air to brace him for the day's encounters. By degrees, he regained his
      good cheer and as usual when in rising spirits, his mind turned toward
      Aggie. The second anniversary of their wedding was fast approaching&mdash;he
      began to take notice of various window displays. By the time he had
      reached his office, the weightiest decision on his mind lay in choosing
      between a pearl pendant and a diamond bracelet for his now adorable
      spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a more difficult problem awaited him. Before he was fairly in his
      chair, the telephone bell rang violently. Never guessing who was at the
      other end of the wire, he picked up his receiver and answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise. &ldquo;Mrs. Hardy?&rdquo; Several times he opened
      his lips to ask a question, but it was apparent that the person at the
      other end of the line had a great deal to say and very little time to say
      it, and it was only after repeated attempts that he managed to get in a
      word or so edgewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's happened?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing to anybody,&rdquo; was Zoie's noncommittal answer, &ldquo;not even to
      Aggie. Jump in a taxi and come as quickly as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what IS it?&rdquo; persisted Jimmy. The dull sound of the wire told him
      that the person at the other end had &ldquo;hung up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy gazed about the room in perplexity. What was he to do? Why on earth
      should he leave his letters unanswered and his mail topsy turvy to rush
      forth in the shank of the morning at the bidding of a young woman whom he
      abhorred. Ridiculous! He would do no such thing. He lit a cigar and began
      to open a few letters marked &ldquo;private.&rdquo; For the life of him he could not
      understand one word that he read. A worried look crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Zoie were really in need of help, Aggie would certainly never
      forgive him if he failed her.&rdquo; He rose and walked up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was he not to tell Aggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was Alfred?&rdquo; He stopped abruptly. His over excited imagination had
      suggested a horrible but no doubt accurate answer. &ldquo;Wedded to an
      abomination like Zoie, Alfred had sought the only escape possible to a man
      of his honourable ideals&mdash;he had committed suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seizing his coat and hat Jimmy dashed through the outer office without
      instructing his astonished staff as to when he might possibly return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Family troubles,&rdquo; said the secretary to himself as he appropriated one of
      Jimmy's best cigars.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      LESS than half an hour later, Jimmy's taxi stopped in front of the
      fashionable Sherwood Apartments where Zoie had elected to live. Ascending
      toward the fifth floor he scanned the face of the elevator boy expecting
      to find it particularly solemn because of the tragedy that had doubtless
      taken place upstairs. He was on the point of sending out a &ldquo;feeler&rdquo; about
      the matter, when he remembered Zoie's solemn injunction to &ldquo;say nothing to
      anybody.&rdquo; Perhaps it was even worse than suicide. He dared let his
      imagination go no further. By the time he had put out his hand to touch
      the electric button at Zoie's front door, his finger was trembling so that
      he wondered whether he could hit the mark. The result was a very faint
      note from the bell, but not so faint that it escaped the ear of the
      anxious young wife, who had been pacing up and down the floor of her
      charming living room for what seemed to her ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, hurry, hurry!&rdquo; Zoie cried through her tears to her neat little
      maid servant, then reaching for her chatelaine, she daubed her small nose
      and flushed cheeks with powder, after which she nodded to Mary to open the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jimmy, the maid's pert &ldquo;good-morning&rdquo; seemed to be in very bad taste
      and to properly reprove her he assumed a grave, dignified air out of which
      he was promptly startled by Zoie's even more unseemly greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jimmy!&rdquo; she snapped. Her tone was certainly not that of a
      heart-broken widow. &ldquo;It's TIME you got here,&rdquo; she added with an injured
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy gazed at Zoie in astonishment. She was never what he would have
      called a sympathetic woman, but really&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came the moment you 'phoned me,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;what is it? What's the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's awful,&rdquo; sniffled Zoie. And she tore up and down the room regardless
      of the fact that Jimmy was still unseated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awful what?&rdquo; questioned Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worst I've ever had,&rdquo; sobbed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything wrong with Alfred?&rdquo; ventured Jimmy. And he braced himself for
      her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; sobbed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed Jimmy, feeling sure that his worst fears were about to be
      realised. &ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; sniffled Zoie, &ldquo;I just 'phoned his office. He isn't
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; answered Jimmy, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Just another
      little family tiff,&rdquo; he was unable to conceal a feeling of thankfulness.
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie measured Jimmy with a dangerous gleam in her eyes. She resented the
      patronising tone that he was adopting. How dare he be cheerful when she
      was so unhappy&mdash;and because of him, too? She determined that his
      self-complacency should be short-lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred has found out that I lied about the luncheon,&rdquo; she said, weighing
      her words and their effect upon Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luncheon?&rdquo; stuttered Jimmy, feeling sure that Zoie had suddenly
      marked him for her victim, but puzzled as to what form her persecution was
      about to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luncheon?&rdquo; repeated Zoie, trying apparently to conceal her disgust
      at his dulness. &ldquo;OUR luncheon yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you LIE,&rdquo; asked Jimmy, his eyes growing rounder and rounder with
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know he KNEW,&rdquo; answered Zoie innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo; questioned Jimmy, more and more befogged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I'd eaten with a man,&rdquo; concluded Zoie impatiently. Then she turned
      her back upon Jimmy and again dashed up and down the room occupied with
      her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly difficult to get much understanding out of Zoie's
      disjointed observations, but Jimmy was doing his best. He followed her
      restless movements about the room with his eyes, and then ventured a timid
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn't object to your eating with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, couldn't he?&rdquo; cried Zoie, and she turned upon him with a look of
      contempt. &ldquo;If there's anything that he DOESN'T object to,&rdquo; she continued,
      &ldquo;I haven't found it out yet.&rdquo; And with that she threw herself in a large
      arm chair near the table, and left Jimmy to draw his own conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked about the room as though expecting aid from some unseen
      source; then his eyes sought the floor. Eventually they crept to the tip
      of Zoie's tiny slipper as it beat a nervous tattoo on the rug. To save his
      immortal soul, Jimmy could never help being hypnotised by Zoie's small
      feet. He wondered now if they had been the reason of Alfred's first
      downfall. He recalled with a sigh of relief that Aggie's feet were large
      and reassuring. He also recalled an appropriate quotation: &ldquo;The path of
      virtue is not for women with small feet,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;Yes, Aggie's feet are
      undoubtedly large,&rdquo; he concluded. But all this was not solving Zoie's
      immediate problem; and an impatient cough from her made him realise that
      something was expected of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you lunch with me,&rdquo; he asked, with a touch of irritation, &ldquo;if you
      thought he wouldn't like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hungry,&rdquo; snapped Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; grunted Jimmy, and in spite of his dislike of the small creature his
      vanity resented the bald assertion that she had not lunched with him for
      his company's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have made an engagement with you of course,&rdquo; she continued,
      with a frankness that vanquished any remaining conceit that Jimmy might
      have brought with him. &ldquo;I explained to you how it was at the time. It was
      merely a case of convenience. You know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was beginning to see it more and more in the light of an
      inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn't been in front of that horrid old restaurant just when I was
      passing,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;all this would never have happened. But you were
      there, and you asked me to come in and have a bite with you; and I did,
      and there you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there I am,&rdquo; assented Jimmy dismally. There was no doubt about where
      he was now, but where was he going to end? That was the question. &ldquo;See
      here,&rdquo; he exclaimed with fast growing uneasiness, &ldquo;I don't like being
      mixed up in this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you'd think of yourself first,&rdquo; sneered Zoie. &ldquo;That's just like
      a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want to get your husband down on me,&rdquo; argued Jimmy
      evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't give YOU away,&rdquo; sneered Zoie. &ldquo;YOU needn't worry,&rdquo; and she
      fixed her eyes upon him with a scornful expression that left no doubt as
      to her opinion that he was a craven coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said he'd 'found out,'&rdquo; stammered Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's found out that I ate with a MAN,&rdquo; answered Zoie, more and more
      aggrieved at having to employ so much detail in the midst of her distress.
      &ldquo;He doesn't know it was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Zoie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a small hand, begging him to spare her further questions. It
      was apparent that she must explain each aspect of their present
      difficulty, with as much patience as though Jimmy were in reality only a
      child. She sank into her chair and then proceeded, with a martyred air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it was like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Alfred came into the restaurant
      just after we had gone out and Henri, the waiter who has taken care of him
      for years, told him that I had just been in to luncheon with a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy shifted about on the edge of his chair, ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if Alfred had only told me that in the first place,&rdquo; she continued,
      &ldquo;I'd have known what to say, but he didn't. Oh no, he was as sweet as
      could be all through breakfast and last night too, and then just as he was
      leaving this morning, I said something about luncheon and he said, quite
      casually, 'Where did you have luncheon YESTERDAY, my dear?' So I answered
      quite carelessly, 'I had none, my love.' Well, I wish you could have seen
      him. He called me dreadful things. He says I'm the one thing he can't
      endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; questioned Jimmy, wondering how Alfred could confine
      himself to any &ldquo;ONE thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says I'm a liar!&rdquo; shrieked Zoie tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, aren't you?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; declared Zoie; &ldquo;but why shouldn't I be?&rdquo; She looked at
      Jimmy with such an air of self-approval that for the life of him he could
      find no reason to offer. &ldquo;You know how jealous Alfred is,&rdquo; she continued.
      &ldquo;He makes such a fuss about the slightest thing that I've got out of the
      habit of EVER telling the TRUTH.&rdquo; She walked away from Jimmy as though
      dismissing the entire matter; he shifted his position uneasily; she turned
      to him again with mock sweetness. &ldquo;I suppose YOU told AGGIE all about it?&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's round eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped lower. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don't
      believe I did,&rdquo; he stammered weakly. &ldquo;I didn't think of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven for that!&rdquo; concluded Zoie with tightly pressed lips. Then
      she knotted her small white brow in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy regarded her with growing uneasiness. &ldquo;What are you up to now?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know yet,&rdquo; mused Zoie, &ldquo;BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL AGGIE&mdash;that's
      ONE SURE thing.&rdquo; And she pinned him down with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will tell her,&rdquo; asserted Jimmy, with a wag of his very round
      head. &ldquo;Aggie is just the one to get you out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's just the one to make things worse,&rdquo; said Zoie decidedly. Then
      seeing Jimmy's hurt look, she continued apologetically: &ldquo;Aggie MEANS all
      right, but she has an absolute mania for mixing up in other people's
      troubles. And you know how THAT always ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never deceived my wife in all my life,&rdquo; declared Jimmy, with an air of
      self approval that he was far from feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jimmy,&rdquo; protested Zoie impatiently, &ldquo;you aren't going to have moral
      hydrophobia just when I need your help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to lie to Aggie, if that's what you mean,&rdquo; said Jimmy,
      endeavouring not to wriggle under Zoie's disapproving gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't,&rdquo; answered Zoie sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy never feared Zoie more than when she APPEARED to agree with him. He
      looked at her now with uneasy distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her the truth,&rdquo; urged Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; declared Jimmy with an emphatic nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'LL DENY IT,&rdquo; concluded Zoie with an impudent toss of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, and he felt himself getting onto his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've already denied it to Alfred,&rdquo; continued Zoie. &ldquo;I told him I'd never
      been in that restaurant without him in all my life, that the waiter had
      mistaken someone else for me.&rdquo; And again she turned her back upon Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you see,&rdquo; protested Jimmy, &ldquo;this would all be so very much
      simpler if you'd just own up to the truth now, before it's too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS too late,&rdquo; declared Zoie. &ldquo;Alfred wouldn't believe me now, whatever
      I told him. He says a woman who lies once lies all the time. He'd think
      I'd been carrying on with you ALL ALONG.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; groaned Jimmy as the full realisation of his predicament
      thrust itself upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't DARE tell him now,&rdquo; continued Zoie, elated by the demoralised
      state to which she was fast reducing him. &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, don't make
      it any worse,&rdquo; she concluded; &ldquo;it's bad enough as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy, and he sank dejectedly into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you DO tell him,&rdquo; threatened Zoie from the opposite side of the table,
      &ldquo;I'll say you ENTICED me into the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; shrieked Jimmy and again he found himself on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; insisted Zoie, &ldquo;I give you fair warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in absolute horror. &ldquo;I don't believe you've any
      conscience at all,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't,&rdquo; she sniffled. &ldquo;I'm too miserable.&rdquo; And throwing herself into
      the nearest armchair she wept copiously at the thought of her many
      injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncertain whether to fly or to remain, Jimmy gazed at her gloomily. &ldquo;Well,
      I'M not laughing myself to death,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Zoie turned upon him vehemently. &ldquo;I just wish I'd never laid
      eyes on you, Jimmy,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was wishing the very same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I cared about you,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;it wouldn't be so bad; but to think
      of losing my Alfred for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; words failed her and she trailed
      off weakly,&mdash;&ldquo;for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; grunted Jimmy curtly. In spite of himself he was always miffed
      by the uncomplimentary way in which she disposed of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sarcasm was lost upon Zoie. Having finished all she had to say to him,
      she was now apparently bent upon indulging herself in a first class fit of
      hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are critical moments in all of our lives when our future happiness
      or woe hangs upon our own decision. Jimmy felt intuitively that he was
      face to face with such a moment, but which way to turn? that was the
      question. Being Jimmy, and soft-hearted in spite of his efforts to conceal
      it, he naturally turned the wrong way, in other words, towards Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; he said awkwardly, as he crossed to the arm of her chair.
      &ldquo;This will soon blow over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie only sobbed the louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't the first time you and Alfred have called it all off,&rdquo; he
      reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy could never remember quite how it happened. But apparently he must
      have patted Zoie on the shoulder. At any rate, something or other loosened
      the flood-gates of her emotion, and before Jimmy could possibly escape
      from her vicinity she had wheeled round in her chair, thrown her arms
      about him, and buried her tear-stained face against his waist-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, for the third time that morning, as he
      glanced nervously toward the door; but Zoie was exclaiming in her own way
      and sobbing louder and louder; furthermore she was compelling Jimmy to
      listen to an exaggerated account of her many disappointments in her
      unreasonable husband. Seeing no possibility of escape, without resorting
      to physical violence, Jimmy stood his ground, wondering what to expect
      next. He did not have long to wonder.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      WITHIN an hour from the time Alfred had entered his office that morning he
      was leaving it, in a taxi, with his faithful secretary at his side, and
      his important papers in a bag at his feet. &ldquo;Take me to the Sherwood,&rdquo; he
      commanded the driver, &ldquo;and be quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they neared Alfred's house, Johnson could feel waves of increasing
      anger circling around his perturbed young employer and later when they
      alighted from the taxi it was with the greatest difficulty that he could
      keep pace with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for Jimmy, the outer door of the Hardy apartment had been
      left ajar, and thus it was that he was suddenly startled from Zoie's
      unwelcome embraces by a sharp exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; cried Alfred, and he brought his fist down with emphasis on the
      centre table at Jimmy's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wheeling about, Jimmy beheld his friend face to face with him. Alfred's
      lips were pressed tightly together, his eyes flashing fire. It was
      apparent that he desired an immediate explanation. Jimmy turned to the
      place where Zoie had been, to ask for help; like the traitress that she
      was, he now saw her flying through her bedroom door. Again he glanced at
      Alfred, who was standing like a sentry, waiting for the pass-word that
      should restore his confidence in his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I've disturbed you,&rdquo; sneered Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not at all,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, affecting a careless indifference
      that he did not feel and unconsciously shaking hands with the waiting
      secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reminded of the secretary's presence in such a distinctly family scene,
      Alfred turned to him with annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into my study,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll be with you presently. Here's your
      list,&rdquo; he added and he thrust a long memorandum into the secretary's hand.
      Johnson retired as unobtrusively as possible and the two old friends were
      left alone. There was another embarrassed silence which Jimmy, at least,
      seemed powerless to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Alfred in a threatening tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerably well,&rdquo; answered Jimmy in his most pleasant but slightly nervous
      manner. Then followed another pause in which Alfred continued to eye his
      old friend with grave suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; stammered Jimmy, &ldquo;I just came over to bring Aggie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       he corrected himself&mdash;&ldquo;that is, to bring Zoie a little message from
      Aggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to be a SAD one,&rdquo; answered Alfred, with a sarcastic smile, as
      he recalled the picture of Zoie weeping upon his friend's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;no!&rdquo; answered Jimmy, with an elaborate attempt at
      carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you generally play the messenger during business hours?&rdquo; thundered
      Alfred, becoming more and more enraged at Jimmy's petty evasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just SOMETIMES,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, persisting in his amiable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Alfred, and there was a solemn warning in his voice, &ldquo;don't
      YOU lie to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy started as though shot. The consciousness of his guilt was strong
      upon him. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he gasped, for the want of anything more
      intelligent to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't do it well,&rdquo; continued Alfred, &ldquo;and you and I are old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's round eyes fixed themselves on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife has been telling you her troubles,&rdquo; surmised Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy tried to protest, but the lie would not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Alfred, &ldquo;I'll tell you something too. I've done
      with her.&rdquo; He thrust his hands in his pockets and began to walk up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a turbulent household,&rdquo; thought Jimmy and then he set out in pursuit
      of his friend. &ldquo;I'm sorry you've had a misunderstanding,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misunderstanding!&rdquo; shouted Alfred, turning upon him so sharply that he
      nearly tripped him up, &ldquo;we've never had anything else. There was never
      anything else for us TO have. She's lied up hill and down dale from the
      first time she clinched her baby fingers around my hand&mdash;&rdquo; he
      imitated Zoie's dainty manner&mdash;&ldquo;and said 'pleased to meet you!' But
      I've caught her with the goods this time,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and I've just
      about got HIM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; echoed Jimmy weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wife-stealer,&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, and he clinched his fists in
      anticipation of the justice he would one day mete out to the despicable
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Jimmy had been called many things in his time, he realised that he
      would doubtless be called many more things in the future, but never by the
      wildest stretch of imagination, had he ever conceived of himself in the
      role of &ldquo;wife-stealer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mistaking Jimmy's look of amazement for one of incredulity, Alfred
      endeavoured to convince him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, YOU'LL meet a wife-stealer sooner or later,&rdquo; he assured him. &ldquo;You
      needn't look so horrified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy only stared at him and he continued excitedly: &ldquo;She's had the
      effrontery&mdash;the bad taste&mdash;the idiocy to lunch in a public
      restaurant with the blackguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mere sound of the word made Jimmy shudder, but engrossed in his own
      troubles Alfred continued without heeding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henri, the head-waiter, told me,&rdquo; explained Alfred, and Jimmy remembered
      guiltily that he had been very bumptious with the fellow. &ldquo;You know the
      place,&rdquo; continued Alfred, &ldquo;the LaSalle&mdash;a restaurant where I am known&mdash;where
      she is known&mdash;where my best friends dine&mdash;where Henri has looked
      after me for years. That shows how desperate she is. She must be mad about
      the fool. She's lost all sense of decency.&rdquo; And again Alfred paced the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't go as far as that,&rdquo; stammered Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wouldn't you?&rdquo; cried Alfred, again turning so abruptly that Jimmy
      caught his breath. Each word of Jimmy's was apparently goading him on to
      greater anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't get hasty,&rdquo; Jimmy almost pleaded. &ldquo;The whole thing is no doubt
      perfectly innocent. Talk to her gently. Win her confidence. Get her to
      tell you the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; shouted Alfred in derision. &ldquo;Zoie! The truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy feared that his young friend might actually become violent. Alfred
      bore down upon him like a maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; he repeated wildly. &ldquo;She wouldn't know the truth if she saw
      it under a microscope. She's the most unconscionable little liar that ever
      lured a man to the altar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy rolled his round eyes with feigned incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it out before we'd been married a month,&rdquo; continued Alfred. &ldquo;She
      used to sit evenings facing the clock. I sat with my back to it. I used to
      ask her the time. Invariably she would lie half an hour, backward or
      forward, just for practice. THAT was the BEGINNING. Here, listen to some
      of these,&rdquo; he added, as he drew half a dozen telegrams from his inner
      pocket, and motioned Jimmy to sit at the opposite side of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy would have preferred to stand, but it was not a propitious time to
      consult his own preferences. He allowed himself to be bullied into the
      chair that Alfred suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing himself into the opposite chair, Alfred selected various exhibits
      from his collection of messages. &ldquo;I just brought these up from the
      office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are some of the telegrams that she sent me each
      day last week while I was away. This is Monday's.&rdquo; And he proceeded to
      read with a sneering imitation of Zoie's cloy sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Darling, so lonesome without you. Cried all day. When are you coming
      home to your wee sad wifie? Love and kisses. Zoie.'&rdquo; Tearing the
      defenceless telegram into bits, Alfred threw it from him and waited for
      his friend's verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sent that over the wire?&rdquo; gasped Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's nothing,&rdquo; answered Alfred. &ldquo;That's a mild one.&rdquo; And he
      selected another from the same pocket. &ldquo;Here, listen to this. This is what
      she REALLY did. This is from my secretary the same night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spied upon her!&rdquo; asked Jimmy, feeling more and more convinced that
      his own deceptions would certainly be run to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAVE to spy upon her,&rdquo; answered Alfred, &ldquo;in self-defence. It's the only
      way I can keep her from making me utterly ridiculous.&rdquo; And he proceeded to
      read from the secretary's telegram. &ldquo;'Shopped all morning. Lunched at
      Martingale's with man and woman unknown to me&mdash;Martingale's,'&rdquo; he
      repeated with a sneer&mdash;&ldquo;'Motored through Park with Mrs. Wilmer until
      five.' Mrs. Wilmer,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;there's a woman I've positively
      forbidden her to speak to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy only shook his head and Alfred continued to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Had tea with Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and young Ardesley at the Park View.'
      Ardesley is a young cub,&rdquo; explained Alfred, &ldquo;who spends his time running
      around with married women while their husbands are away trying to make a
      living for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shocking!&rdquo; was the extent of Jimmy's comment, and Alfred resumed reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dinner and theatre same party. Supper at Wellingford. Home two A. M.'&rdquo;
       He looked at Jimmy, expecting to hear Zoie bitterly condemned. Jimmy only
      stared at him blankly. &ldquo;That's pretty good,&rdquo; commented Alfred, &ldquo;for the
      woman who 'CRIED' all day, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Jimmy made no answer, and Alfred brought his fist down upon the
      table impatiently. &ldquo;Isn't it?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a bit busy THAT day,&rdquo; admitted Jimmy uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; cried Alfred again, as he rose and paced about excitedly.
      &ldquo;Getting the truth out of Zoie is like going to a fire in the night. You
      think it's near, but you never get there. And when she begins by saying
      that she's going to tell you the 'REAL truth'&rdquo;&mdash;he threw up his hands
      in despair&mdash;&ldquo;well, then it's time to leave home.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was another pause, then Alfred drew in his breath and bore down upon
      Jimmy with fresh vehemence. &ldquo;The only time I get even a semblance of truth
      out of Zoie,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is when I catch her red-handed.&rdquo; Again he pounded
      the table and again Jimmy winced. &ldquo;And even then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;she
      colours it so with her affected innocence and her plea about just wishing
      to be a 'good fellow,' that she almost makes me doubt my own eyes. She is
      an artist,&rdquo; he declared with a touch of enforced admiration. &ldquo;There's no
      use talking; that woman is an artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, for the want of anything better
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to leave her,&rdquo; declared Alfred emphatically. &ldquo;I am going
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint hope lit Jimmy's round childlike face. With Alfred away there
      would be no further investigation of the luncheon incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be a good idea,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's THE idea,&rdquo; said Alfred; &ldquo;most of my business is in Detroit anyhow.
      I'm going to make that my headquarters and stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was almost smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Zoie,&rdquo; continued Alfred, &ldquo;she can stay right here and go as far as
      she likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with me,&rdquo; thought Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; shrieked Alfred, with renewed emphasis, &ldquo;I'm going to find out who
      the FELLOW is. I'll have THAT satisfaction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's spirits fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henri knows the head-waiter of every restaurant in this town,&rdquo; said
      Alfred, &ldquo;that is, every one where she'd be likely to go; and he says he'd
      recognise the man she lunched with if he saw him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's features became suddenly distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minute she appears anywhere with anybody,&rdquo; explained Alfred, &ldquo;Henri
      will be notified by 'phone. He'll identify the man and then he'll wire
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; asked Jimmy weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the first train home,&rdquo; declared Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; questioned Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To shoot him!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped Jimmy, almost losing his footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred mistook Jimmy's concern for anxiety on his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll be acquitted,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Don't you worry. I'll get my tale
      of woe before the jury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say,&rdquo; protested Jimmy, too uneasy to longer conceal his real
      emotions, &ldquo;why kill this one particular chap when there are so many
      others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the only one she's ever lunched with, ALONE,&rdquo; said Alfred. &ldquo;She's
      been giddy, but at least she's always been chaperoned, except with him.
      He's the one all right; there's no doubt about it. He's the beginning of
      the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His own end, yes,&rdquo; assented Jimmy half to himself. &ldquo;Now, see here, old
      man,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;I'd give that poor devil a chance to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain!&rdquo; shouted Alfred so sharply that Jimmy quickly retreated. &ldquo;I
      wouldn't believe him now if he were one of the Twelve Apostles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's tough,&rdquo; murmured Jimmy as he saw the last avenue of honourable
      escape closed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tough!&rdquo; roared Alfred, thinking of himself. &ldquo;Hah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Apostles, I mean,&rdquo; explained Jimmy nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Alfred paced up and down the room, and again Jimmy tried to think of
      some way to escape from his present difficulty. It was quite apparent that
      his only hope lay not in his own candor, but in Alfred's absence. &ldquo;How
      long do you expect to be away?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only until I hear from Henri,&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henri?&rdquo; repeated Jimmy and again a gleam of hope shone on his dull
      features. He had heard that waiters were often to be bribed. &ldquo;Nice fellow,
      Henri,&rdquo; he ventured cautiously. &ldquo;Gets a large salary, no doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, with a certain pride of proprietorship. &ldquo;No
      tips could touch Henri, no indeed. He's not that sort of a person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the hope faded from Jimmy's round face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look upon Henri as my friend,&rdquo; continued Alfred enthusiastically. &ldquo;He
      speaks every language known to man. He's been in every country in the
      world. HENRI UNDERSTANDS LIFE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LOTS of people UNDERSTAND LIFE,&rdquo; commented Jimmy dismally, &ldquo;but SOME
      people don't APPRECIATE it. They value it too lightly, to MY way of
      thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you have something to live for,&rdquo; argued Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have indeed; a great deal,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy, more and more abused at the
      thought of what he was about to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's different,&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred. &ldquo;But what have <i>I</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was in no frame of mind to consider his young friend's assets, he
      was thinking of his own difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a laughing stock,&rdquo; shouted Alfred. &ldquo;I know it. A 'good thing' who
      gives his wife everything she asks for, while she is running around with&mdash;with
      my best friend, for all I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; protested Jimmy nervously. &ldquo;I wouldn't say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if she weren't running around,&rdquo; continued Alfred excitedly, without
      heeding his friend's interruption, &ldquo;what have we to look forward to? What
      have we to look backward to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Jimmy's face was a blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred answered his own question by lifting his arms tragically toward
      Heaven. &ldquo;One eternal round of wrangles and rows! A childless home! Do you
      think she wants babies?&rdquo; he cried, wheeling about on Jimmy, and daring him
      to answer in the affirmative. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;All she wants is a
      good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; mumbled Jimmy, &ldquo;I can't see much in babies myself, fat, little,
      red worms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred's breath went from him in astonishment
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren't YOU ever a fat, little, red worm?&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Wasn't <i>I</i>
      ever a little, fat, red&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he paused in confusion, as his ear
      became puzzled by the proper sequence of his adjectives, &ldquo;a fat, red,
      little worm,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;and see what we are now!&rdquo; He thrust out his
      chest and strutted about in great pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big red worms,&rdquo; admitted Jimmy gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred did not hear him. &ldquo;You and I ought to have SONS on the way to
      what we are,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, better,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy, thinking of his present plight. &ldquo;Much
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But HAVE we?&rdquo; demanded Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy glanced about the room, as though expecting an answering
      demonstration from the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have YOU?&rdquo; persisted Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy shook his head solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have <i>I</i>?&rdquo; asked the irate husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of sheer absent mindedness Jimmy shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual Alfred answered his own question. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he raged. &ldquo;YOU have a
      wife who spends her time and money gadding about with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's face showed a new alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;my wife,&rdquo; concluded Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy breathed a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a wife,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;who spends her time and my money gadding
      around with God knows whom. But I'll catch him!&rdquo; he cried with new fury.
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, pulling a roll of bills from his pocket. &ldquo;I'll bet you
      I'll catch him. How much do you want to bet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undesirous of offering any added inducements toward his own capture, Jimmy
      backed away both literally and figuratively from Alfred's proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use of getting so excited?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistaking Jimmy's unwillingness to bet for a disinclination to take
      advantage of a friend's reckless mood, Alfred resented the implied insult
      to his astuteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I can't catch him?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Let's see the colour of your
      money,&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Jimmy could comply, an unexpected voice broke into the argument
      and brought them both round with a start.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens,&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, who had entered the room while Alfred was
      talking his loudest. &ldquo;What a racket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell upon Jimmy who was teetering about uneasily just behind
      Alfred. She stared at him in amazement. Was it possible that Jimmy, the
      methodical, had left his office at this hour of the morning, and for what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoiding the question in Aggie's eyes, Jimmy pretended to be searching for
      his pocket handkerchief&mdash;but always with the vision of Aggie in her
      new Fall gown and her large &ldquo;picture&rdquo; hat at his elbow. Never before had
      she appeared so beautiful to him, so desirable&mdash;suppose he should
      lose her? Life spread before him as a dreary waste. He tried to look up at
      her; he could not. He feared she would read his guilt in his eyes. &ldquo;What
      guilt?&rdquo; he asked himself. There was no longer any denying the fact&mdash;a
      secret had sprung up between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annoyed at receiving no greeting, Aggie continued in a rather hurt voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you two going to speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred swallowed hard in an effort to regain his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully convinced of a disagreement between the two old friends, Aggie
      addressed herself in a reproachful tone to Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what are you doing here this time of day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy felt Alfred's steely eyes upon him. &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Why, I
      just came over to&mdash;bring your message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My message?&rdquo; repeated Aggie in perplexity. &ldquo;What message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred's eyebrows drew themselves sharply together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy had told so many lies this morning that another more or less could
      not matter; moreover, this was not a time to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the message you sent to Zoie,&rdquo; he answered boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I sent no message to Zoie,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; thundered Alfred, so loud that Aggie's fingers involuntarily went
      to her ears. She was more and more puzzled by the odd behaviour of the
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean yesterday's message,&rdquo; corrected Jimmy. And he assumed an aggrieved
      air toward Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You villain,&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie. &ldquo;I told you to 'phone her yesterday
      morning from the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy placidly, &ldquo;but I forgot it and I just came
      over to explain.&rdquo; Alfred's fixed stare was relaxing and at last Jimmy
      could breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Aggie, with a wise little elevation of her eye-brows, &ldquo;then
      that's why Zoie didn't keep her luncheon appointment with me yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy felt that if this were to go on much longer, he would utter one wild
      shriek and give himself up for lost; but at present he merely swallowed
      with an effort, and awaited developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Alfred's turn to become excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, IS it!&rdquo; he cried with hysterical laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie regarded him with astonishment. Was this her usually self-controlled
      friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; sneered Alfred with unmistakable pity for her credulity. &ldquo;That's
      not why my wife didn't eat luncheon with you. She may TELL you that's why.
      She undoubtedly will; but it's NOT why. Oh, no!&rdquo; and running his hands
      through his hair, Alfred tore up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Aggie asked in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dear husband Jimmy will doubtless explain,&rdquo; answered Alfred with a
      slur on the &ldquo;dear.&rdquo; Then he turned toward the door of his study. &ldquo;Pray
      excuse me&mdash;I'M TOO BUSY,&rdquo; and with that he strode out of the room and
      banged the study door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; gasped Aggie. She looked after Alfred, then at Jimmy.
      She was the picture of consternation. &ldquo;What's the matter with him?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just another little family tiff,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, trying to assume a
      nonchalant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not about YOU!&rdquo; gasped Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Jimmy, his equilibrium again upset. &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wasn't it?&rdquo; answered Aggie. &ldquo;That just shows how silly one can be. I
      almost thought Alfred was going to say that Zoie had lunched with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; again echoed Jimmy, and he wondered if everybody in the world had
      conspired to make him the target of their attention. He caught Aggie's eye
      and tried to laugh carelessly. &ldquo;That would have been funny, wouldn't it?&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wouldn't it,&rdquo; repeated Aggie, and he thought he detected a slight
      uneasiness in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of lunch,&rdquo; added Jimmy quickly, &ldquo;I think, dearie, that I'll come
      home for lunch in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie in great amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those downtown places upset my digestion,&rdquo; explained Jimmy quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't this very SUDDEN,&rdquo; she asked, and again Jimmy fancied that there
      was a shade of suspicion in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face assumed a martyred expression. &ldquo;Of course, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if
      you insist upon my eating downtown, I'll do it; but I thought you'd be
      glad to have me at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie turned to him with real concern. &ldquo;Why, Jimmy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what's the
      matter with you?&rdquo; She took a step toward him and anxiously studied his
      face. &ldquo;I never heard you talk like that before. I don't think you're
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what I'm telling you,&rdquo; insisted Jimmy vehemently, excited
      beyond all reason by receiving even this small bit of sympathy. &ldquo;I'm ill,&rdquo;
       he declared. No sooner had he made the declaration than he began to
      believe in it. His doleful countenance increased Aggie's alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My angel-face,&rdquo; she purred, and she took his chubby cheeks in her hands
      and looked down at him fondly. &ldquo;You know I ALWAYS want you to come home.&rdquo;
       She stooped and kissed Jimmy's pouting lips. He held up his face for more.
      She smoothed the hair from his worried brow and endeavoured to cheer him.
      &ldquo;I'll run right home now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell cook to get something nice
      and tempting for you! I can see Zoie later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter,&rdquo; murmured Jimmy, as he followed her toward the door
      with a doleful shake of his head. &ldquo;I don't suppose I shall ever enjoy my
      luncheon again&mdash;as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried Aggie, &ldquo;come along.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN Alfred returned to the living room he was followed by his secretary,
      who carried two well-filled satchels. His temper was not improved by the
      discovery that he had left certain important papers at his office.
      Dispatching his man to get them and to meet him at the station with them,
      he collected a few remaining letters from the drawer of the writing table,
      then uneasy at remaining longer under the same roof with Zoie, he picked
      up his hat, and started toward the hallway. For the first time his eye was
      attracted by a thick layer of dust and lint on his coat sleeve. Worse
      still, there was a smudge on his cuff. If there was one thing more than
      another that Alfred detested it was untidiness. Putting his hat down with
      a bang, he tried to flick the dust from his sleeve with his pocket
      handkerchief; finding this impossible, he removed his coat and began to
      shake it violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this particular moment that Zoie's small face appeared
      cautiously from behind the frame of the bedroom door. She was quick to
      perceive Alfred's plight. Disappearing from view for an instant, she soon
      reappeared with Alfred's favourite clothes-brush. She tiptoed into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barely had Alfred drawn his coat on his shoulders, when he was startled by
      a quick little flutter of the brush on his sleeve. He turned in surprise
      and beheld Zoie, who looked up at him as penitent and irresistible as a
      newly-punished child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; snarled Alfred, and he glared at her as though he would enjoy
      strangling her on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, and he knew she was going to add her customary
      appeal of &ldquo;Let's make up.&rdquo; But Alfred was in no mood for nonsense. He
      thrust his hands in his pockets and made straight for the outer doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling to herself as she saw him leaving without his hat, Zoie slipped it
      quickly beneath a flounce of her skirt. No sooner had Alfred reached the
      sill of the door than his hand went involuntarily to his head; he turned
      to the table where he had left his hat. His face wore a puzzled look. He
      glanced beneath the table, in the chair, behind the table, across the
      piano, and then he began circling the room with pent up rage. He dashed
      into his study and out again, he threw the chairs about with increasing
      irritation, then giving up the search, he started hatless toward the
      hallway. It was then that a soft babyish voice reached his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you lost something, dear?&rdquo; cooed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred hesitated. It was difficult to lower his dignity by answering her,
      but he needed his headgear. &ldquo;I want my hat,&rdquo; he admitted shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hat?&rdquo; repeated Zoie innocently and she glanced around the room with
      mild interest. &ldquo;Maybe Mary took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; cried Alfred, and thinking the mystery solved, he dashed toward
      the inner hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let ME get it, dear,&rdquo; pleaded Zoie, and she laid a small detaining hand
      upon his arm as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; commanded Alfred hotly, and he shook the small hand from his
      sleeve as though it had been something poisonous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Allie,&rdquo; protested Zoie, pretending to be shocked and grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you 'but Allie' me,&rdquo; cried Alfred, turning upon her sharply. &ldquo;All I
      want is my hat,&rdquo; and again he started in search of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but Allie,&rdquo; stammered Zoie, as she followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but,&rdquo; repeated Alfred, turning on her in a fury.
      &ldquo;You've butted me out of everything that I wanted all my life, but you're
      not going to do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you said it yourself,&rdquo; laughed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said WHAT,&rdquo; roared Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; tittered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remnants of Alfred's self-control were forsaking him. He clinched his
      fists hard in a final effort toward restraint. &ldquo;You'd just as well stop
      all these baby tricks,&rdquo; he threatened between his teeth, &ldquo;they're not
      going to work. THIS time my mind is made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you afraid to talk to me?&rdquo; asked Zoie sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I was afraid?&rdquo; demanded Alfred hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ACT like it,&rdquo; declared Zoie, with some truth on her side. &ldquo;You don't
      want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she got no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I want,&rdquo; interrupted Alfred, &ldquo;is to get out of this house once and
      for all and to stay out of it.&rdquo; And again he started in pursuit of his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Allie,&rdquo; she gazed at him with deep reproach. &ldquo;You liked this place
      so much when we first came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Alfred picked at the lint on his coat sleeve. Edging her way toward
      him cautiously she ventured to touch his sleeve with the brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll attend to that myself,&rdquo; he said curtly, and he sank into the nearest
      chair to tie a refractory shoe lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me brush you, dear,&rdquo; pleaded Zoie. &ldquo;I don't wish you to start out in
      the world looking unbrushed,&rdquo; she pouted. Then with a sly emphasis she
      added teasingly, &ldquo;The OTHER women might not admire you that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred broke his shoe string then and there. While he stooped to tie a
      knot in it, Zoie managed to perch on the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Allie,&rdquo; she continued coaxingly, &ldquo;no one could ever love you as
      I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Alfred broke his shoe lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allie!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a little ripple of childish laughter, &ldquo;do
      you remember how absurdly poor we were when we were first married, and how
      you refused to take any help from your family? And do you remember that
      silly old pair of black trousers that used to get so thin on the knees and
      how I used to put shoe-blacking underneath so the white wouldn't show
      through?&rdquo; By this time her arm managed to get around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; shrieked Alfred as though mortal man could endure no more.
      &ldquo;You've used those trousers to settle every crisis in our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie gazed at him without daring to breathe; even she was aghast at his
      fury, but only temporarily. She recovered herself and continued sweetly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If everything is SETTLED,&rdquo; she argued, &ldquo;where's the harm in talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've DONE with talking,&rdquo; declared Alfred. &ldquo;From this on, I act.&rdquo; And
      determined not to be cheated out of this final decision, he again started
      for the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allie!&rdquo; cried Zoie in a tone of sharp alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself Alfred turned to learn the cause of her anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't got your overshoes on,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speechless with rage, Alfred continued on his way, but Zoie moved before
      him swiftly. &ldquo;I'll get them for you, dear,&rdquo; she volunteered graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; thundered Alfred. They were now face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't roar like that,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, and the pink tips of
      her fingers were thrust tight against her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred drew in his breath and endeavoured for the last time to repress his
      indignation. &ldquo;Either you can't, or you won't understand that it is
      extremely unpleasant for me to even talk to you&mdash;much less to receive
      your attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered Zoie, unperturbed. &ldquo;But so long as I am your
      lawful wedded wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she emphasised the &ldquo;lawful&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
      shan't let any harm come to you, if <i>I</i> can help it.&rdquo; She lifted her
      eyes to heaven bidding it to bear witness to her martyrdom and looking for
      all the world like a stained glass saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; shouted Alfred, almost hysterical at his apparent failure to
      make himself understood. &ldquo;You wouldn't let any harm come to me. Oh, no.
      You've only made me the greatest joke in Chicago,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You've
      only made me such a laughing stock that I have to leave it. That's all&mdash;that's
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Chicago!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie incredulously. Then regaining her
      self-composure, she edged her way close to him and looked up into his eyes
      in baby-like wonderment. &ldquo;Why, Allie, where are we going?&rdquo; Her small arm
      crept up toward his shoulder. Alfred pushed it from him rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WE are not going,&rdquo; he asserted in a firm, measured voice. &ldquo;<i>I</i> am
      going. Where's my hat?&rdquo; And again he started in search of his absent
      headgear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Allie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and this time there was genuine alarm in her
      voice, &ldquo;you wouldn't leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't I, though?&rdquo; sneered Alfred. Before he knew it, Zoie's arms were
      about him&mdash;she was pleading desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here, Allie, you may call me all the names you like,&rdquo; she cried
      with great self-abasement, &ldquo;but you shan't&mdash;you SHAN'T go away from
      Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed?&rdquo; answered Alfred as he shook himself free of her. &ldquo;I suppose
      you'd like me to go on with this cat and dog existence. You'd like me to
      stay right here and pay the bills and take care of you, while you flirt
      with every Tom, Dick and Harry in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only your horrid disposition that makes you talk like that,&rdquo;
       whimpered Zoie. &ldquo;You know very well that I never cared for anybody but
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you GOT me, yes,&rdquo; assented Alfred, &ldquo;and NOW you care for everybody
      BUT me.&rdquo; She was about to object, but he continued quickly. &ldquo;Where you
      MEET your gentlemen friends is beyond me. <i>I</i> don't introduce them to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; agreed Zoie, and there was a touch of vindictiveness
      in her voice. &ldquo;The only male creature that you ever introduced to me was
      the family dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I introduce every man who's fit to meet you,&rdquo; declared Alfred with an air
      of great pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't speak very well for your acquaintances,&rdquo; snipped Zoie. Even
      HER temper was beginning to assert itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't bicker like this,&rdquo; declared Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you always say, when you can't think of an answer,&rdquo; retorted
      Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean when I'm tired of answering your nonsense!&rdquo; thundered Alfred.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Realising that she was rapidly losing ground by exercising her advantage
      over Alfred in the matter of quick retort, Zoie, with her customary
      cunning, veered round to a more conciliatory tone. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she cooed,
      &ldquo;suppose I DID eat lunch with a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; shrieked Alfred, as though he had at last run his victim to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She retreated with her fingers crossed. &ldquo;I only said suppose,&rdquo; she
      reminded him quickly. Then she continued in a tone meant to draw from him
      his heart's most secret confidence. &ldquo;Didn't you ever eat lunch with any
      woman but me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; answered Alfred firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an unmistakable expression of pleasure on Zoie's small face, but
      she forced back the smile that was trying to creep round her lips, and
      sidled toward Alfred, with eyes properly downcast. &ldquo;Then I'm very sorry I
      did it,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;and I'll never do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; cried Alfred with renewed indignation. &ldquo;You admit it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to please you, dear,&rdquo; explained Zoie sweetly, as though she were
      doing him the greatest possible favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To please me?&rdquo; gasped Alfred. &ldquo;Do you suppose it pleases me to know that
      you are carrying on the moment my back is turned, making a fool of me to
      my friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends?&rdquo; cried Zoie with a sneer. This time it was her turn to be
      angry. &ldquo;So! It's your FRIENDS that are worrying you!&rdquo; In her excitement
      she tossed Alfred's now damaged hat into the chair just behind her. He was
      far too overwrought to see it. &ldquo;<i>I</i> haven't done you any harm,&rdquo; she
      continued wildly. &ldquo;It's only what you think your friends think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't done me any harm?&rdquo; repeated Alfred, in her same tragic key,
      &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! You've only cheated me out of everything I expected to get
      out of life! That's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie came to a full stop and waited for him to enumerate the various
      treasures that he had lost by marrying her. He did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we were married,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you pretended to adore children.
      You started your humbugging the first day I met you. I refer to little
      Willie Peck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hysterical giggle very nearly betrayed her. Alfred continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was fool enough to let you know that I admire women who like children.
      From that day until the hour that I led you to the altar, you'd fondle the
      ugliest little brats that we met in the street, but the moment you GOT me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred!&rdquo; gasped Zoie. This was really going too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I repeat it!&rdquo; shouted Alfred, pounding the table with his fist for
      emphasis. &ldquo;The moment you GOT me, you declared that all children were
      horrid little insects, and that someone ought to sprinkle bug-powder on
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; protested Zoie, shocked less by Alfred's interpretation of her
      sentiments, than by the vulgarity with which he expressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On another occasion,&rdquo; declared Alfred, now carried away by the recital of
      his long pent up wrongs, &ldquo;you told me that all babies should be put in
      cages, shipped West, and kept in pens until they got to be of an
      interesting age. 'Interesting age!'&rdquo; he repeated with a sneer, &ldquo;meaning
      old enough to take YOU out to luncheon, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said any such thing,&rdquo; objected Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was the idea,&rdquo; insisted Alfred. &ldquo;I haven't your glib way of
      expressing myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You manage to express yourself very well,&rdquo; retorted Zoie. &ldquo;When you have
      anything DISAGREEABLE to say. As for babies,&rdquo; she continued tentatively,
      &ldquo;I think they are all very well in their PLACE, but they were NEVER meant
      for an APARTMENT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offered you a house in the country,&rdquo; shouted Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country!&rdquo; echoed Zoie. &ldquo;How could I live in the country, with people
      being murdered in their beds every night? Read the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always an excuse,&rdquo; sighed Alfred resignedly. &ldquo;There always HAS been and
      there always would be if I'd stay to listen. Well, for once,&rdquo; he declared,
      &ldquo;I'm glad that we have no children. If we had, I might feel some
      obligation to keep up this farce of a marriage. As it is,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;YOU are free and <i>I</i> am free.&rdquo; And with a courtly wave of his arm,
      he dismissed Zoie and the entire subject, and again he started in pursuit
      of Mary and his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's your freedom you wish,&rdquo; pouted Zoie with an abused air, &ldquo;you
      might have said so in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred stopped in sheer amazement at the cleverness with which the little
      minx turned his every statement against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not very manly of you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to abuse me just because
      you've found someone whom you like better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not true,&rdquo; protested Alfred hotly, &ldquo;and you know it's not true.&rdquo;
       Little did he suspect the trap into which she was leading him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you DON'T love anybody more than you do me?&rdquo; she cried eagerly, and
      she gazed up at him with adoring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say any such thing,&rdquo; hedged Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you DO,&rdquo; she accused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DON'T,&rdquo; he declared in self defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry of joy, she sprang into his arms, clasped her fingers tightly
      behind his neck, and rained impulsive kisses upon his unsuspecting face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, Alfred looked down at Zoie, undecided whether to strangle
      her or to return her embraces. As usual, his self-respect won the day for
      him and, with a determined effort, he lifted her high in the air, so that
      she lost her tenacious hold of him, and sat her down with a thud in the
      very same chair in which she had lately dropped his hat. Having acted with
      this admirable resolution, he strode majestically toward the inner hall,
      but before he could reach it, Zoie was again on her feet, in a last vain
      effort to conciliate him. Turning, Alfred caught sight of his poor
      battered hat. This was the final spur to action. Snatching it up with one
      hand, and throwing his latchkey on the table with the other, he made
      determinedly for the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Screaming hysterically, Zoie caught him just as he reached the threshold
      and threw the whole weight of her body upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;if you REALLY love me, you CAN'T leave me like
      this!&rdquo; Her emotion was now genuine. He looked down at her gravely&mdash;then
      into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other things more important than what YOU call 'love,'&rdquo; he
      said, very solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a thing as a soul, if you only knew it. And you have hurt
      mine through and through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how, Alfred, how?&rdquo; asked the small person, and there was a frown of
      genuine perplexity on her tiny puckered brow. &ldquo;What have I REALLY DONE,&rdquo;
       She stroked his hand fondly; her baby eyes searched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so much what people DO to us that counts,&rdquo; answered Alfred in a
      proud hurt voice. &ldquo;It's how much they DISAPPOINT us in what they do. I
      expected better of YOU,&rdquo; he said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll DO better,&rdquo; coaxed Zoie, &ldquo;if you'll only give me a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was half inclined to believe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Allie,&rdquo; she pleaded, perceiving that his resentment was dying and
      resolved to, at last, adopt a straight course, &ldquo;if you'll only listen,
      I'll tell you the REAL TRUTH.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unprepared for the electrical effect of her remark, Zoie found herself
      staggering to keep her feet. She gazed at Alfred in amazement. His arms
      were lifted to Heaven, his breath was coming fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The REAL TRUTH!'&rdquo; he gasped, then bringing his crushed hat down on his
      forehead with a resounding whack, he rushed from her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clang of the closing elevator door brought Zoie to a realisation of
      what had actually happened. Determined that Alfred should not escape her
      she rushed to the hall door and called to him wildly. There was no answer.
      Running back to the room, she threw open the window and threw herself half
      out of it. She was just in time to see Alfred climb into a passing taxi.
      &ldquo;Alfred!&rdquo; she cried. Then automatically she flew to the 'phone. &ldquo;Give me
      4302 Main,&rdquo; she called and she tried to force back her tears. &ldquo;Is this
      Hardy &amp; Company?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is Mrs. Hardy,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd ring me up the moment my husband comes in.&rdquo; There was a
      slight pause, then she clutched the receiver harder. &ldquo;Not COMING back?&rdquo;
       she gasped. &ldquo;Gone!&mdash;to Detroit?&rdquo; A short moan escaped her lips. She
      let the receiver fall back on the hook and her head went forward on her
      outstretched arms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Jimmy came home to luncheon that day, Aggie succeeded in getting a
      general idea of the state of affairs in the Hardy household. Of course
      Jimmy didn't tell the whole truth. Oh, no&mdash;far from it. In fact, he
      appeared to be aggravatingly ignorant as to the exact cause of the Hardy
      upheaval. Of ONE thing, however, he was certain. &ldquo;Alfred was going to quit
      Chicago and leave Zoie to her own devices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; cried Aggie. &ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; and before Jimmy was fairly out of the
      front gate, she had seized her hat and gloves and rushed to the rescue of
      her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not surprised at finding Zoie in a state of collapse, Aggie opened her
      arms sympathetically to receive the weeping confidences that she was sure
      would soon come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoie dear,&rdquo; she said as the fragile mite rocked to and fro. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
       She pressed the soft ringlets from the girl's throbbing forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Alfred,&rdquo; sobbed Zoie. &ldquo;He's gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; answered Aggie tenderly. &ldquo;Isn't it awful? Jimmy just told
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy told you WHAT?&rdquo; questioned Zoie, and she lifted her head and
      regarded Aggie with sudden uneasiness. Her friend's answer raised Jimmy
      considerably in Zoie's esteem. Apparently he had not breathed a word about
      the luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jimmy told me,&rdquo; continued Aggie, &ldquo;that you and Alfred had had
      another tiff, and that Alfred had gone for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For GOOD!&rdquo; echoed Zoie and her eyes were wide with terror. &ldquo;Did Alfred
      tell Jimmy that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he MEANS it!&rdquo; cried Zoie, at last fully convinced of the strength of
      Alfred's resolve. &ldquo;But he shan't,&rdquo; she declared emphatically. &ldquo;I won't let
      him. I'll go after him. He has no right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; By this time she
      was running aimlessly about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to him?&rdquo; asked Aggie, feeling sure that Zoie was as usual
      at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Zoie with wide innocent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; echoed Aggie, with little confidence in her friend's ability to
      judge impartially about so personal a matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely nothing,&rdquo; affirmed Zoie. And there was no doubting that she at
      least believed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he SAY,&rdquo; questioned Aggie diplomatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He SAYS I 'hurt his soul.' Whatever THAT is,&rdquo; answered Zoie, and her face
      wore an injured expression. &ldquo;Isn't that a nice excuse,&rdquo; she continued,
      &ldquo;for leaving your lawful wedded wife?&rdquo; It was apparent that she expected
      Aggie to rally strongly to her defence. But at present Aggie was bent upon
      getting facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HOW did you hurt him?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ate lunch,&rdquo; said Zoie with the face of a cherub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; questioned Aggie slyly. She was beginning to scent the
      probable origin of the misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's of no consequence,&rdquo; answered Zoie carelessly; &ldquo;I wouldn't have wiped
      my feet on the man.&rdquo; By this time she had entirely forgotten Aggie's
      proprietorship in the source of her trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who WAS the man?&rdquo; urged Aggie, and in her mind, she had already
      condemned him as a low, unprincipled creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter?&rdquo; asked Zoie impatiently. &ldquo;It's ANY man with Alfred&mdash;you
      know that&mdash;ANY man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie sank in a chair and looked at her friend in despair. &ldquo;Why DO you do
      these things,&rdquo; she said wearily, &ldquo;when you know how Alfred feels about
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as though I did nothing else,&rdquo; answered Zoie with an aggrieved
      tone. &ldquo;It's the first time since I've been married that I've ever eaten
      lunch with any man but Alfred. I thought you'd have a little sympathy with
      me,&rdquo; she whimpered, &ldquo;instead of putting me on the gridiron like everyone
      else does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone else?&rdquo; questioned Aggie, with recurring suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Alfred,&rdquo; explained Zoie. &ldquo;HE'S 'everyone else' to me.&rdquo; And then
      with a sudden abandonment of grief, she threw herself prostrate at her
      friend's knees. &ldquo;Oh, Aggie, what can I do?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aggie was not satisfied with Zoie's fragmentary account of her latest
      escapade. &ldquo;Is that the only thing that Alfred has against you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the LATEST,&rdquo; sniffled Zoie, in a heap at Aggie's feet. And then
      she continued in a much aggrieved tone, &ldquo;You know he's ALWAYS rowing
      because we haven't as many babies as the cook has cats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you get him a baby?&rdquo; asked the practical, far-seeing
      Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late NOW,&rdquo; moaned Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; reassured Aggie. &ldquo;It's the very thing that would bring him
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How COULD I get one?&rdquo; questioned Zoie, and she looked up at Aggie with
      round astonished eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adopt it,&rdquo; answered Aggie decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie regarded her friend with mingled disgust and disappointment. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       she said with a sigh and a shake of her head, &ldquo;that wouldn't do any good.
      Alfred's so fussy. He always wants his OWN things around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needn't know,&rdquo; declared Aggie boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; whispered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing herself up with an air of great importance, and regarding the
      wondering young person at her knee with smiling condescension, Aggie
      prepared to make a most interesting disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a long article in the paper only this morning,&rdquo; she told Zoie,
      &ldquo;saying that three thousand husbands in this VERY CITY are fondling babies
      not their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie turned her small head to one side, the better to study Aggie's face.
      It was apparent to the latter that she must be much more explicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babies adopted in their absence,&rdquo; explained Aggie, &ldquo;while they were on
      trips around the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dangerous light began to glitter in Zoie's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie!&rdquo; she cried, bringing her small hands together excitedly, &ldquo;do you
      think I COULD?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Aggie, with a very superior air. Zoie's enthusiasm was
      increasing her friend's admiration of her own scheme. &ldquo;This same paper
      tells of a woman who adopted three sons while her husband was in Europe,
      and he thinks each one of them is his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we get some?&rdquo; cried Zoie, now thoroughly enamoured of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can always get TONS of them at the Children's Home,&rdquo; answered Aggie
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't endure babies,&rdquo; declared Zoie, &ldquo;but I'd do ANYTHING to get Alfred
      back. Can we get one TO-DAY?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie looked at her small friend with positive pity. &ldquo;You don't WANT one
      TO-DAY,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie rolled her large eyes inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to get one to-day,&rdquo; continued Aggie, &ldquo;Alfred would know it
      wasn't yours, wouldn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light of understanding began to show on Zoie's small features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was none when he left this morning,&rdquo; added Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; acquiesced Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must wait awhile,&rdquo; counselled Aggie, &ldquo;and then get a perfectly new
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Zoie had never been taught to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Aggie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie continued without heeding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a few months,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;when Alfred's temper has had time to
      cool, we'll get Jimmy to send him a wire that he has an heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few months!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, as though Aggie had suggested an eternity.
      &ldquo;I've never been away from Alfred that long in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie was visibly annoyed. &ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; she said coldly, as she rose
      to go, &ldquo;if you can get Alfred back WITHOUT that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't!&rdquo; cried Zoie, and she clung to her friend as to her last
      remaining hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; answered Aggie, somewhat mollified by Zoie's complete submission.
      &ldquo;THIS is the only way. The President of the Children's Home is a great
      friend of Jimmy's,&rdquo; she said proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Zoie made her first practical suggestion. &ldquo;Then
      we'll LET JIMMY GET IT,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Aggie enthusiastically, as though they would be
      according the poor soul a rare privilege. &ldquo;Jimmy gives a hundred dollars
      to the Home every Christmas,&rdquo;&mdash;additional proof why he should be
      selected for this very important office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie with shocked surprise. &ldquo;If Alfred were to
      give a hundred dollars to a Baby's Home, I should suspect him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly!&rdquo; snapped Aggie curtly. In spite of her firm faith in
      Jimmy's innocence, she was undoubtedly annoyed by Zoie's unpleasant
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant's pause, then putting disagreeable thoughts from her
      mind, Aggie turned to Zoie with renewed enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get down to business,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we'll begin on the baby's
      outfit at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its what?&rdquo; queried Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its clothes,&rdquo; explained Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what fun!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, and she clapped her hands merrily like a
      very small child. A moment later she stopped with sudden misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aggie,&rdquo; she said fearfully, &ldquo;suppose Alfred shouldn't come back
      after I've got the baby? I'd be a widow with a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's sure to come back!&rdquo; answered Aggie, with a confident air. &ldquo;He'll
      take the first train, home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he will,&rdquo; assented Zoie joyfully. All her clouds were again
      dispelled. &ldquo;Aggie,&rdquo; she cried impulsively, &ldquo;you are a darling. You have
      just saved my life.&rdquo; And she clasped her arms so tightly around Aggie's
      neck that her friend was in danger of being suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Releasing herself Aggie continued with a ruffled collar and raised vanity:
      &ldquo;You can write him an insinuating letter now and then, just to lead up to
      the good news gradually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie tipped her small head to one side and studied her friend
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;Do you know, Aggie,&rdquo; she said, with frank admiration, &ldquo;I
      believe you are a better liar than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm NOT a liar,&rdquo; objected Aggie vehemently, &ldquo;at least, not often,&rdquo; she
      corrected. &ldquo;I've never lied to Jimmy in all my life.&rdquo; She drew herself up
      with conscious pride. &ldquo;And Jimmy has NEVER LIED TO ME.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that nice,&rdquo; sniffed Zoie and she pretended to be searching for her
      pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aggie did not see her. She was glancing at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; she said. And she started toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aggie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested Zoie, unwilling to be left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll run in again at tea time,&rdquo; promised Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind the DAYS,&rdquo; whined Zoie, &ldquo;but when NIGHT comes I just MUST
      have somebody's arms around me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoie!&rdquo; gasped Aggie, both shocked and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it,&rdquo; confessed Zoie; &ldquo;the moment it gets dark I'm just
      scared stiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no way for a MOTHER to talk,&rdquo; reproved Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, horrified at the sudden realisation that this
      awful appellation would undoubtedly pursue her for the rest of her life.
      &ldquo;Oh, don't call me that,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;You make me feel a thousand years
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; laughed Aggie, and before Zoie could again detain her she was
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the outside door had closed behind her friend, Zoie gazed about the
      room disconsolately, but her depression was short-lived. Remembering
      Aggie's permission about the letter, she ran quickly to the writing table,
      curled her small self up on one foot, placed a brand new pen in the
      holder, then drew a sheet of paper toward her and, with shoulders hunched
      high and her face close to the paper after the manner of a child, she
      began to pen the first of a series of veiled communications that were
      ultimately to fill her young husband with amazement.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Jimmy reached his office after his unforeseen call upon Zoie, his
      subsequent encounter with Alfred, and his enforced luncheon at home with
      Aggie, he found his mail, his 'phone calls, and his neglected appointments
      in a state of hopeless congestion, and try as he would, he could not
      concentrate upon their disentanglement. Growing more and more furious with
      the long legged secretary who stood at the corner of his desk, looking
      down upon him expectantly, and waiting for his tardy instructions, Jimmy
      rose and looked out of the window. He could feel Andrew's reproachful eyes
      following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall Miss Perkins take your letters now?&rdquo; asked Andrew, and he wondered
      how late the office staff would be kept to-night to make up for the time
      that was now being wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming after repeated wounds from his nearest and dearest, Andrew's
      implied reproach was too much for Jimmy's overwrought nerves. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;
       he answered unceremoniously. And when Andrew could assure himself that he
      had heard aright, he stalked out of the door with his head high in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked after his departing secretary with positive hatred. It was
      apparent to him that the whole world was against him. He had been too easy
      he decided. His family, friends, and business associates had undoubtedly
      lost all respect for him. From this day forth he was determined to show
      himself to be a man of strong mettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made this important decision and having convinced himself that he
      was about to start on a new life, Jimmy strode to the door of the office
      and, without disturbing the injured Andrew, he called sharply to Miss
      Perkins to come at once and take his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jimmy! Again he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of the
      &ldquo;cut-glass&rdquo; industry. Invariably his mind would wander back to the
      unexpected incidents of the morning. Stopping suddenly in the middle of a
      letter to a competing firm, he began pacing hurriedly up and down the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she not feared that her chief might misconstrue any suggestion from
      her as an act of impertinence, Miss Perkins, having learned all the
      company's cut-glass quotations by rote, could easily have supplied the
      remainder of the letter. As it was, she waited impatiently, tapping the
      corner of the desk with her idle pencil. Jimmy turned at the sound, and
      glanced at the pencil with unmistakable disapproval. Miss Perkins waited
      in silence. After one or two more uneasy laps about the room, Jimmy went
      to his 'phone and called his house number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's undoubtedly domestic trouble,&rdquo; decided Miss Perkins, and she
      wondered whether it would be delicate of her, under the circumstances, to
      remain in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her employer's conversation at the 'phone, it was clear to Miss
      Perkins that Mrs. Jinks was spending the afternoon with Mrs Hardy, but why
      this should have so annoyed MR. Jinks was a question that Miss Perkins
      found it difficult to answer. Was it possible that Mr. Jinks's present
      state of unrest could be traced to the door of the beautiful young wife of
      his friend? &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; thought Miss Perkins, &ldquo;how scandalous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; commanded Jimmy, interrupting Miss Perkins's interesting
      speculations, and he nodded toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Miss Perkins, as she glanced at the
      unfinished letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll call you when I need you,&rdquo; answered Jimmy gruffly. Miss Perkins left
      the room in high dudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'LL show them,&rdquo; said Jimmy to himself, determined to carry out his
      recent resolve to be firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his mind wend back to his domestic troubles. &ldquo;Suppose, that Zoie,
      after imposing secrecy upon him, should change that thing called her
      'mind' and confide in Aggie about the luncheon?&rdquo; Jimmy was positively
      pale. He decided to telephone to Zoie's house and find out how affairs
      were progressing. At the 'phone he hesitated. &ldquo;If Aggie HAS found out
      about the luncheon,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;my 'phoning to Zoie's will increase her
      suspicions. If Zoie has told her nothing, she'll wonder why I'm 'phoning
      to Zoie's house. There's only one thing to do,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;I must wait
      and say nothing. I can tell from Aggie's face when I meet her at dinner
      whether Zoie has betrayed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this conclusion, Jimmy resolved to get home as early as
      possible, and again Miss Perkins was called to his aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flurry with which Jimmy despatched the day's remaining business
      confirmed both Miss Perkins and Andrew in their previous opinion that &ldquo;the
      boss&rdquo; had suddenly &ldquo;gone off his head.&rdquo; And when he at last left the
      office and banged the door behind him there was a general sigh of relief
      from his usually tranquil staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of walking, as was his custom, Jimmy took a taxi to his home but
      alas, to his surprise he found no wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mrs. Jinks leave any word?&rdquo; he inquired from the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; answered that unperturbed creature; and Jimmy felt sure
      that the attitude of his office antagonists had communicated itself to his
      household servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jimmy's anxious ear at last caught the rustle of a woman's dress in
      the hallway, his dinner had been waiting half an hour, and he had worked
      himself into a state of fierce antagonism toward everything and everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Aggie's voice however, his heart began to pound with fear.
      &ldquo;Had she found him out for the weak miserable deceiver that he was? Would
      she tell him that they were going to separate forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie's first words were reassuring. &ldquo;Awfully sorry to be so late, dear,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy felt her kiss upon his chubby cheek and her dear arms about his
      neck. He decided forthwith to tell her everything, and never, never again
      to run the risk of deceiving her; but before he could open his lips, she
      continued gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've brought Zoie home with me, dear. There's no sense in her eating all
      alone, and she's going to have ALL her dinners with us.&rdquo; Jimmy groaned.
      &ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo; continued Aggie, &ldquo;you and I can take her to the theatre
      and all those places and keep her cheered until Alfred comes home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home?&rdquo; repeated Jimmy in alarm. Was it possible that Alfred had already
      relented?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he doesn't know it yet,&rdquo; explained Aggie, &ldquo;but he's coming. We'll
      tell you all about it at dinner.&rdquo; And they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting for Aggie, Jimmy had thought himself hungry, but once the
      two women had laid before him their &ldquo;nefarious baby-snatching scheme&rdquo;&mdash;food
      lost its savour for him, and one course after another was taken away from
      him untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time that Jimmy ventured a mild objection to his part in the plan, as
      scheduled by them, he met the threatening eye of Zoie; and by the time
      that the three left the table he was so harassed and confused by the
      chatter of the two excited women, that he was not only reconciled but
      eager to enter into any scheme that might bring Alfred back, and free him
      of the enforced companionship of Alfred's nerve-racking wife. True, he
      reflected, it was possible that Alfred, on his return, might discover him
      to be the culprit who lunched with Zoie and might carry out his murderous
      threat; but even such a fate was certainly preferable to interminable
      evenings spent under the same roof with Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All YOU need do, Jimmy,&rdquo; explained Aggie sweetly, when the three of them
      were comfortably settled in the library, &ldquo;is to see your friend the
      Superintendent of the Babies' Home, and tell him just what kind of a baby
      we shall need, and when we shall need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we see it ourselves?&rdquo; chimed in Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Aggie confidently, and she turned to Jimmy with a
      matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;You'd better tell the Superintendent to have several
      for us to look at when the time arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's better,&rdquo; agreed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jimmy, he had long ceased to make any audible comment, but
      internally he was saying to himself: &ldquo;man of strong mettle, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll attend to all the clothes for the child,&rdquo; said Aggie generously to
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want everything to be hand-made,&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can make a great many of the things ourselves, evenings,&rdquo; said Aggie,
      &ldquo;while we sit here and talk to Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we were going OUT evenings!&rdquo; objected Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy rolled his eyes toward her like a dumb beast of burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MOST evenings,&rdquo; assented Aggie. &ldquo;And then toward the last, you know, Zoie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       she hesitated to explain further, for Jimmy was already becoming visibly
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, that's true,&rdquo; blushed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awkward pause, then Aggie turned again toward Jimmy, who was
      pretending to rebuild the fire. &ldquo;Oh yes, one more thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When
      everything is quite ready for Alfred's return, we'll allow you, Jimmy
      dear, to wire him the good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, so much,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were time to wire now,&rdquo; said Zoie pensively, and in his mind,
      Jimmy fervently agreed with that sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next few months will slip by before you know it,&rdquo; declared Aggie
      cheerfully. &ldquo;And by the way, Zoie,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;why should you go back to
      your lonesome flat to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie began to feel for her pocket handkerchief&mdash;Jimmy sat up to
      receive the next blow. &ldquo;Stay here with us,&rdquo; suggested Aggie. &ldquo;We'll be so
      glad to have you.&rdquo; She included Jimmy in her glance. &ldquo;Won't we, dear?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two girls went upstairs arm in arm that night, Jimmy remained in
      his chair by the fire, too exhausted to even prepare for bed. &ldquo;A man of
      mettle!&rdquo; he said again to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had certainly been the longest day of his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN Aggie predicted that the few months of waiting would pass quickly for
      Zoie, she was quite correct. They passed quickly for Aggie as well; but
      how about Jimmy? When he afterward recalled this interval in his life, it
      was always associated with long strands of lace winding around the legs of
      the library chairs, white things lying about in all the places where he
      had once enjoyed sitting or lying, late dinners, lonely breakfasts, and a
      sense of isolation from Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when he had waited until he was out of all patience with
      Aggie, he was told by his late and apologetical spouse that she had been
      helping Zoie to redecorate her bedroom to fit the coming occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all done in pink and white,&rdquo; explained Aggie, and then followed
      detailed accounts of the exquisite bed linens, the soft lovely hangings,
      and even the entire relighting of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why pink?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, objecting to any scheme of Zoie's on general
      principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Alfred's favourite colour,&rdquo; explained Aggie. &ldquo;Besides, it's so
      becoming,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy could not help feeling that this lure to Alfred's senses was
      absolutely indecent, and he said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; answered Aggie, quite affronted, &ldquo;you are getting as
      unreasonable as Alfred himself.&rdquo; Then as Jimmy prepared to sulk, she added
      coaxingly, &ldquo;I was GOING to tell you about Zoie's lovely new negligee, and
      about the dear little crib that just matches it. Everything is going to be
      in harmony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Zoie in the house?&rdquo; asked Jimmy sceptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't think why you've taken such a dislike to that helpless child,&rdquo;
       said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, while in the midst of his morning's mail, Jimmy was
      informed that it was now time for him to conduct Aggie and Zoie to the
      Babies' Home to select the last, but most important, detail for their
      coming campaign. According to instructions, Jimmy had been in
      communication with the amused Superintendent of the Home, and he now led
      the two women forth with the proud consciousness that he, at least, had
      attended properly to his part of the business. By the time they reached
      the Children's Home, several babies were on view for their critical
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie stared into the various cribs containing the wee, red mites with
      puckered faces. &ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;haven't you any white ones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are supposed to be white,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, with an
      indulgent smile, &ldquo;the black ones are on the other side of the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black ones!&rdquo; cried Zoie in horror, and she faced about quickly as though
      expecting an attack from their direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which particular one of these would you recommend?&rdquo; asked the practical
      Aggie of the Superintendent as she surveyed the first lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's largely a matter of taste, ma'am,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;This seems a
      healthy little chap,&rdquo; he added, and seizing the long white clothes of the
      nearest infant, he drew him across his arm and held him out for Aggie's
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see,&rdquo; cried Zoie, and she stood on tiptoe to peep over the
      Superintendent's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jimmy, he stood gloomily apart. This was an ordeal for which he had
      long been preparing himself, and he was resolved to accept it
      philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think much of that one,&rdquo; snipped Zoie. And in spite of himself.
      Jimmy felt his temper rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie turned to him with a smile. &ldquo;Which one do YOU prefer, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not MY affair,&rdquo; answered Jimmy curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie perceived trouble brewing, and she turned to pacify Jimmy. &ldquo;Which
      one do you think your FRIEND ALFRED would like?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were in his place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Jimmy hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you AREN'T,&rdquo; interrupted Zoie; then she turned to the
      Superintendent. &ldquo;What makes some of them so much larger than others?&rdquo; she
      asked, glancing at the babies he had CALLED &ldquo;white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see they're of different ages,&rdquo; explained the Superintendent
      indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We told Mr. Jinks they must all be of the same age,&rdquo; said Zoie with a
      reproachful look at Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What age is that?&rdquo; asked the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say a week old,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this is the one for you,&rdquo; decided the Superintendent, designating
      his first choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we'd better take the Superintendent's advice,&rdquo; said Aggie
      complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie looked around the room with a dissatisfied air. Was it possible that
      all babies were as homely as these?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Zoie,&rdquo; explained Aggie, divining her thought, &ldquo;they get better
      looking as they grow older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn't look worse!&rdquo; was Zoie's disgusted comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch it home, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, who had considered his mission completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't expect US to carry it, do you?&rdquo; asked Aggie in a hurt voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent settled the difficulty temporarily by informing them
      that the baby could not possibly leave the home until the mother had
      signed the necessary papers for its release.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought all those details had been attended to,&rdquo; said Aggie, and again
      the two women surveyed Jimmy with grieved disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get the mother's signature the first thing in the morning,&rdquo;
       volunteered the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Zoie, &ldquo;and in the meantime, I'll send some new clothes
      for it,&rdquo; and with a lofty farewell to the Superintendent, she and Aggie
      followed Jimmy down stairs to the taxi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Zoie, when they were properly seated, &ldquo;let's stop at a
      telegraph office and let Jimmy send a wire to Alfred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until we get the baby,&rdquo; cautioned Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have it the first thing in the morning,&rdquo; argued Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy can send him a night-letter,&rdquo; compromised Aggie, &ldquo;that way Alfred
      won't get the news until morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, the taxi stopped in front of Jimmy's office and with
      a sigh of thanksgiving he hurried upstairs to his unanswered mail.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Alfred Hardy found himself on the train bound for Detroit, he tried
      to assure himself that he had done the right thing in breaking away from
      an association that had kept him for months in a constant state of
      ferment. His business must come first, he decided. Having settled this
      point to his temporary satisfaction, he opened his afternoon paper and
      leaned back in his seat, meaning to divert his mind from personal matters,
      by learning what was going on in the world at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had his eye scanned the first headline than he was startled by a
      boisterous greeting from a fellow traveller, who was just passing down the
      aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Hardy!&rdquo; cried his well meaning acquaintance. &ldquo;Where are you bound
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detroit,&rdquo; answered Alfred, annoyed by the sudden interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the missus?&rdquo; asked the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; was Alfred's short reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT'S a funny thing,&rdquo; declared the convivial spirit, not guessing how
      funny it really was. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he continued, so loud that everyone in
      the vicinity could not fail to hear him, &ldquo;the last time I met you two, you
      were on your honeymoon&mdash;on THIS VERY TRAIN,&rdquo; and with that the fellow
      sat himself down, uninvited, by Alfred's side and started on a long list
      of compliments about &ldquo;the fine little girl&rdquo; who had in his opinion done
      Alfred a great favour when she consented to tie herself to a &ldquo;dull,
      money-grubbing chap&rdquo; like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; thought Alfred, &ldquo;this is the way the world sees us.&rdquo; And he began to
      frame inaudible but desperate defences of himself. Again he told himself
      that he was right; but his friend's thoughtless words had planted an
      uncomfortable doubt in his mind, and when he left the train to drive to
      his hotel, he was thinking very little about the new business relations
      upon which he was entering in Detroit, and very much about the domestic
      relations which he had just severed in Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been merely a &ldquo;dull money-grubber&rdquo;? Had he left his wife too much
      alone? Was she not a mere child when he married her? Could he not, with
      more consideration, have made of her a more understanding companion? These
      were questions that were still unanswered in his mind when he arrived at
      one of Detroit's most enterprising hotels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But later, having telephoned to his office and found that several matters
      of importance were awaiting his decision, he forced himself to enter
      immediately upon his business obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might have been expected, Alfred soon won the respect and serious
      consideration of most of his new business associates, and this in a
      measure so mollified his hurt pride, that upon rare occasions he was
      affable enough to accept the hospitality of their homes. But each
      excursion that he made into the social life of these new friends, only
      served to remind him of the unsettled state of his domestic affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How your wife must miss you!&rdquo; his hostess would remark before they were
      fairly seated at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me she is so pretty,&rdquo; his vis-a-vis would exclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is she going to join you?&rdquo; the lady on his left would ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his host would laugh and tell the &ldquo;dear ladies&rdquo; that in HIS opinion,
      Alfred was afraid to bring his wife to Detroit, lest he might lose her to
      a handsomer man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred could never quite understand why remarks such as this annoyed him
      almost to the point of declaring the whole truth. His LEAVING Zoie, and
      his &ldquo;losing&rdquo; her, as these would-be comedians expressed it, were two
      separate and distinct things in his mind, and he felt an almost
      irresistible desire to make this plain to all concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner did he open his lips to do so, than a picture of Zoie in all
      her child-like pleading loveliness, arose to dissuade him. He could
      imagine his dinner companions all pretending to sympathise with him, while
      they flayed poor Zoie alive. She would never have another chance to be
      known as a respectable woman, and compared to most women of his
      acquaintance, she WAS a respectable woman. True, according to
      old-fashioned standards, she had been indiscreet, but apparently the
      present day woman had a standard of her own. Alfred found his eye
      wandering round the table surveying the wives of his friends. Was there
      one of them, he wondered, who had never fibbed to her husband, or eaten a
      simple luncheon unchaperoned by him? Of one thing he was certain, there
      was not one of them so attractive as Zoie. Might she not be forgiven, to
      some extent, if her physical charms had made her a source of dangerous
      temptation to unprincipled scoundrels like the one with whom she had no
      doubt lunched? Then, too, had she not offered at the moment of his
      departure to tell him the &ldquo;real truth&rdquo;? Might this not have been the one
      occasion upon which she would have done so? &ldquo;She seemed so sincere,&rdquo; he
      ruminated, &ldquo;so truly penitent.&rdquo; Then again, how generous it was of her to
      persist in writing to him with never an answer from him to encourage her.
      If she cared for him so little as he had once imagined, why should she
      wish to keep up even a presence of fondness? Her letters indicated an
      undying devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were some of the thoughts that were going through Alfred's mind just
      three months after his departure from Chicago, and all the while his
      hostess was mentally dubbing him a &ldquo;dull person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an abstracted man he is!&rdquo; she said before he was down the front
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he really so clever in business?&rdquo; a woman friend inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard to believe, isn't it?&rdquo; commented a third, and his host
      apologised for the absent Alfred by saying that he was no doubt worried
      about a particular business decision that had to be made the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not the responsibility of this business decision that was
      knotting Alfred's brow, as he walked hurriedly toward the hotel, where he
      had told his office boy to leave the last mail. This had been the longest
      interval that Zoie had ever let slip without writing. He recalled that her
      last letters had hinted at a &ldquo;slight indisposition.&rdquo; In fact, she had even
      mentioned &ldquo;seeing the doctor&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Suppose
      she were really ill? Who would look after her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Alfred reached his rooms, the boy had not yet arrived. He crossed to
      the library table and took from the drawer all the letters thus far
      received from Zoie. He read them consecutively. &ldquo;How could he have been so
      stupid as not to have realised sooner that her illness&mdash;whatever it
      was&mdash;had been gradually creeping upon her from the very first day of
      his departure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy arrived with the mail. It contained no letter from Zoie and Alfred
      went to bed with an uneasy mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he was down at his office early, still no letter from
      Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refusing his partner's invitation to lunch, Alfred sat alone in his
      office, glad to be rid of intrusive eyes. &ldquo;He would write to Jimmy Jinks,&rdquo;
       he decided, &ldquo;and find out whether Zoie were in any immediate danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not willing to await the return of his stenographer, or to acquaint her
      with his personal affairs, Alfred drew pen and paper toward him and sat
      helplessly before it. How could he inquire about Zoie without appearing to
      invite a reconciliation with her? While he was trying to answer this vexed
      question, a sharp knock came at the door. He turned to see a uniformed
      messenger holding a telegram toward him. Intuitively he felt that it
      contained some word about Zoie. His hand trembled so that he could
      scarcely sign for the message before opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the messenger boy was startled out of his lethargy by a
      succession of contradictory exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Alfred incredulously as he gazed in ecstasy at the telegram.
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he shouted, excitedly, as he rose from his chair. &ldquo;Where's a time
      table?&rdquo; he asked the astonished boy, and he began rummaging rapidly
      through the drawers of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo; inquired the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; said Alfred. And he thrust a bill into the small boy's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the boy and disappeared quickly, lest this madman
      might reconsider his generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred threw down the time table in despair. &ldquo;No train for Chicago until
      night,&rdquo; he cried; but his mind was working fast. The next moment he was at
      the telephone, asking for the Division Superintendent of the railway line.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alfred's partner returned from luncheon he found a curt note
      informing him that Alfred had left on a special for Chicago and would
      &ldquo;write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet it's his wife!&rdquo; said the partner.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the evening of the same day that Alfred was enjoying such
      pleasurable emotions, Zoie and Aggie were closeted in the pretty pink and
      white bedroom that the latter had tried to describe to Jimmy. On a
      rose-coloured couch in front of the fire sat Aggie threading ribbons
      through various bits of soft white linen, and in front of her, at the foot
      of a rose-draped bed, knelt Zoie. She was trying the effect of a large
      pink bow against the lace flounce of an empty but inviting bassinette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; she called to Aggie, as she turned her head to one side and
      surveyed the result of her experiment with a critical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie shot a grudging glance at the bassinette. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't
      bother me every moment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll never get all these things
      finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Zoie decided that the bow was properly placed, for she applied
      herself to sewing it fast to the lining. In her excitement she gave the
      thread a vicious pull. &ldquo;Oh, dear, oh dear, my thread is always breaking!&rdquo;
       she sighed in vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're excited,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't YOU be excited,&rdquo; questioned Zoie'&rdquo;if you were expecting a baby
      and a husband in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I should,&rdquo; admitted Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the two friends sewed in silence, then Zoie looked up with
      sudden anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're SURE Jimmy sent the wire?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him write it,&rdquo; answered Aggie, &ldquo;while I was in the office to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will Alfred get it?&rdquo; demanded Zoie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he won't GET it until to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Aggie. &ldquo;I told you
      that to-day. It's a night message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what he'll be doing when he gets it?&rdquo; mused Zoie. There was a
      suspicion of a smile around her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will he do AFTER he gets it?&rdquo; questioned Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up at her friend in alarm, Zoie suddenly ceased sewing. &ldquo;You don't
      mean he won't come?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don't,&rdquo; answered Aggie. &ldquo;He's only HUMAN if he is a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sceptical expression around Zoie's mouth, but she did not
      pursue the subject. &ldquo;How do you suppose that red baby will ever look in
      this pink basket?&rdquo; she asked. And then with a regretful little sigh, she
      declared that she wished she'd &ldquo;used blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think the baby that we chose was so horribly red,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red!&rdquo; cried Zoie, &ldquo;it's magenta.&rdquo; And again her thread broke. &ldquo;Oh, darn!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed in annoyance, and once more rethreaded her needle. &ldquo;I
      couldn't look at it,&rdquo; she continued with a disgusted little pucker of her
      face. &ldquo;I wish they had let us take it this afternoon so I could have got
      used to it before Alfred gets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't be silly,&rdquo; scolded Aggie. &ldquo;You know very well that the
      Superintendent can't let it leave the home until its mother signs the
      papers. It will be here the first thing in the morning. You'll have all
      day to get used to it before Alfred gets here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ALL DAY,&rdquo; echoed Zoie, and the corners of her mouth began to droop.
      &ldquo;Won't Alfred be here before TO-MORROW NIGHT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie was becoming exasperated by Zoie's endless questions. &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo;
       she explained wearily, &ldquo;that the wire won't be delivered until to-morrow
      morning, it will take Alfred eight hours to get here, and there may not be
      a train just that minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight long hours,&rdquo; sighed Zoie dismally. And Aggie looked at her
      reproachfully, forgetting that it is always the last hour that is hardest
      to bear. Zoie resumed her sewing resignedly. Aggie was meditating whether
      she should read her young friend a lecture on the value of patience, when
      the telephone began to ring violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie looked up from her sewing with a frown. &ldquo;You answer it, will you,
      Aggie?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can't let go this thread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; called Aggie sweetly over the 'phone; then she added in surprise,
      &ldquo;Is this you, Jimmy dear?&rdquo; Apparently it was; and as Zoie watched Aggie's
      face, with its increasing distress she surmised that Jimmy's message was
      anything but &ldquo;dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Aggie over the telephone, &ldquo;that's awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't Alfred coming?&rdquo; was the first question that burst from Zoie's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie motioned to Zoie to be quiet. &ldquo;TO-NIGHT!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; echoed Zoie joyfully; and without waiting for more details and
      with no thought beyond the moment, she flew to her dressing table and
      began arranging her hair, powdering her face, perfuming her lips, and
      making herself particularly alluring for the prodigal husband's return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the far-sighted Aggie was experiencing less pleasant sensations at the
      phone. &ldquo;A special?&rdquo; she was saying to Jimmy. &ldquo;When did Alfred GET the
      message?&rdquo; There was a slight pause. Then she asked irritably, &ldquo;Well,
      didn't you mark it 'NIGHT message'?&rdquo; From the expression on Aggie's face
      it was evident that he had not done so. &ldquo;But, Jimmy,&rdquo; protested Aggie,
      &ldquo;this is dreadful! We haven't any baby!&rdquo; Then calling to him to wait a
      minute, and leaving the receiver dangling, she crossed the room to Zoie,
      who was now thoroughly engrossed in the making of a fresh toilet. &ldquo;Zoie!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed excitedly, &ldquo;Jimmy made a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he'd do THAT,&rdquo; answered Zoie carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't understand,&rdquo; persisted Aggie. &ldquo;They sent the 'NIGHT
      message' TO-DAY. Alfred's coming on a special. He'll be here tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness for that!&rdquo; cried Zoie, and the next instant she was
      waltzing gaily about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well,&rdquo; answered Aggie, as she followed Zoie with anxious
      eyes, &ldquo;but WHERE'S YOUR BABY?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Zoie, and for the first time she became conscious of
      their predicament. She gazed at Aggie in consternation. &ldquo;I forgot all
      about it,&rdquo; she said, and then asked with growing anxiety, &ldquo;What can we
      DO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; echoed Aggie, scarcely knowing herself what answer to make, &ldquo;we've
      got to GET it&mdash;TO-NIGHT. That's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Zoie, &ldquo;how CAN we get it when the mother hasn't signed
      the papers yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy will have to arrange that with the Superintendent of the Home,&rdquo;
       answered Aggie with decision, and she turned toward the 'phone to instruct
      Jimmy accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's right,&rdquo; assented Zoie, glad to be rid of all further
      responsibility, &ldquo;we'll let Jimmy fix it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Jimmy,&rdquo; called Aggie excitedly, &ldquo;you'll have to go straight to the
      Children's Home and get that baby just as quickly as you can. There's some
      red tape about the mother signing papers, but don't mind about that. Make
      them give it to you to-night. Hurry, Jimmy. Don't waste a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently a protest from the other end of the wire, for Aggie
      added impatiently, &ldquo;Go on, Jimmy, do! You can EAT any time.&rdquo; And with that
      she hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its clothes,&rdquo; called Zoie frantically. &ldquo;Tell him about the clothes. I
      sent them this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about the clothes,&rdquo; answered Aggie. &ldquo;We're lucky if we get the
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have to mind,&rdquo; persisted Zoie. &ldquo;I gave all its other things to the
      laundress. I wanted them to be nice and fresh. And now the horrid old
      creature hasn't brought them back yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get into your OWN things,&rdquo; commanded Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's my dressing gown?&rdquo; asked Zoie, her elation revived by the thought
      of her fine raiment, and with that she flew to the foot of the bed and
      snatched up two of the prettiest negligees ever imported from Paris.
      &ldquo;Which do you like better?&rdquo; she asked, as she held them both aloft, &ldquo;the
      pink or the blue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter,&rdquo; answered Aggie wearily. &ldquo;Get into SOMETHING, that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then unhook me,&rdquo; commanded Zoie gaily, as she turned her back to Aggie,
      and continued to admire the two &ldquo;creations&rdquo; on her arm. So pleased was she
      with the picture of herself in either of the garments that she began
      humming a gay waltz and swaying to the rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; commanded Aggie, but her warning was unnecessary, for at
      that moment Zoie was transfixed by a horrible fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she said in alarm, &ldquo;that Jimmy can't GET the baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's GOT to get it,&rdquo; answered Aggie emphatically, and she undid the last
      stubborn hook of Zoie's gown and put the girl from her. &ldquo;There, now,
      you're all unfastened,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;hurry and get dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean undressed,&rdquo; laughed Zoie, as she let her pretty evening gown
      fall lightly from her shoulders and drew on her pink negligee. &ldquo;Oh,
      Aggie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she caught sight of her reflection in the
      mirror, &ldquo;isn't it a love? And you know,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Alfred just adores
      pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; answered Aggie, but in spite of herself, she was quite thrilled
      by the picture of the exquisite young creature before her. Zoie had
      certainly never looked more irresistible. &ldquo;Can't you get some of that
      colour out of your cheeks,&rdquo; asked Aggie in despair. &ldquo;You look like a
      washerwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put on some cold cream and powder,&rdquo; answered Zoie. She flew to her
      dressing table; and in a moment there was a white cloud in her immediate
      vicinity. She turned to Aggie to inquire the result. Again the 'phone
      rang. &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; she exclaimed in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see,&rdquo; answered Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn't be Alfred, could it?&rdquo; asked Zoie with mingled hope and dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; answered Aggie, as she removed the receiver from the
      hook. &ldquo;Alfred wouldn't 'phone, he would come right up.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Discovering that it was merely Jimmy &ldquo;on the wire,&rdquo; Zoie's uneasiness
      abated, but Aggie's anxiety was visibly increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where ARE you?&rdquo; she asked of her spouse. &ldquo;The Children's Home!&rdquo; she
      repeated, then followed further explanations from Jimmy which were
      apparently not satisfactory. &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy!&rdquo; cried his disturbed wife, &ldquo;it
      can't be! That's horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; shrieked Zoie, trying to get her small ear close enough to
      the receiver to catch a bit of the obviously terrifying message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called Aggie into the 'phone. Then she turned to Zoie
      with a look of despair. &ldquo;The mother's changed her mind,&rdquo; she explained;
      &ldquo;she won't give up the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; cried Zoie, and she sank into the nearest chair. For an
      instant the two women looked at each other with blank faces. &ldquo;What can we
      DO,&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie did not answer immediately. This was indeed a serious predicament;
      but presently Zoie saw her friend's mouth becoming very resolute, and she
      surmised that Aggie had solved the problem. &ldquo;We'll have to get ANOTHER
      baby, that's all,&rdquo; decided Aggie. &ldquo;There must be OTHER babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, in the Children's Home,&rdquo; answered Aggie with great confidence, and
      she returned to the 'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie crossed to the bed and knelt at its foot in search of her little pink
      slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aggie,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;the others were all so red!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aggie did not heed her protest. &ldquo;Listen, Jimmy,&rdquo; she called in the
      'phone, &ldquo;can't you get another baby?&rdquo; There was a pause, then Aggie
      commanded hotly, &ldquo;Well, GET in the business!&rdquo; Another pause and then Aggie
      continued very firmly, &ldquo;Tell the Superintendent that we JUST MUST have
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie stopped in the act of putting on her second slipper and called a
      reminder to Aggie. &ldquo;Tell him to get a HE one,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Alfred wants a
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take what you can get!&rdquo; answered Aggie impatiently, and again she gave
      her attention to the 'phone. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, with growing despair, and
      Zoie waited to hear what had gone wrong now. &ldquo;Nothing under three months,&rdquo;
       explained Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't that do?&rdquo; asked Zoie innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do!&rdquo; echoed Aggie in disgust. &ldquo;A three-months' old baby is as big as a
      whale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, can't we say it GREW UP?&rdquo; asked Zoie, priding herself on her power
      of ready resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Overnight, like a mushroom?&rdquo; sneered Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost vanquished by her friend's new air of cold superiority, Zoie was
      now on the verge of tears. &ldquo;Somebody must have a new baby,&rdquo; she faltered.
      &ldquo;Somebody ALWAYS has a new baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For their own personal USE, yes,&rdquo; admitted Aggie, &ldquo;but who has a new baby
      for US?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; asked Zoie helplessly. &ldquo;You're the one who ought to know.
      You got me into this, and you've GOT to get me out of it. Can you
      imagine,&rdquo; she asked, growing more and more unhappy, &ldquo;what would happen to
      me if Alfred were to come home now and not find a baby? He wouldn't
      forgive a LITTLE lie, what would he do with a WHOPPER like this?&rdquo; Then
      with sudden decision, she rushed toward the 'phone. &ldquo;Let me talk to
      Jimmy,&rdquo; she said, and the next moment she was chattering so rapidly and
      incoherently over the 'phone that Aggie despaired of hearing one word that
      she said, and retired to the next room to think out a new plan of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Jimmy,&rdquo; stammered Zoie into the 'phone, &ldquo;you've GOT to get me a
      baby. If you don't, I'll kill myself! I will, Jimmy, I will. You got me
      into this, Jimmy,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;You've GOT to get me out of it.&rdquo; And
      then followed pleadings and coaxings and cajolings, and at length, a
      pause, during which Jimmy was apparently able to get in a word or so. His
      answer was not satisfactory to Zoie. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she shrieked, tiptoeing to
      get her lips closer to the receiver; then she added with conviction, &ldquo;the
      mother has no business to change her mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Jimmy maintained that the mother had changed it none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take it away from her,&rdquo; commanded Zoie. &ldquo;Get it quick, while she
      isn't looking.&rdquo; Then casting a furtive glance over her shoulder to make
      sure that Aggie was still out of the room, she indulged in a few dark
      threats to Jimmy, also some vehement reminders of how he had DRAGGED her
      into that horrid old restaurant and been the immediate cause of all the
      misfortunes that had ever befallen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could Jimmy have been sure that Aggie was out of ear-shot of Zoie's
      conversation, the argument would doubtless have kept up indefinitely&mdash;as
      it was&mdash;the result was a quick acquiescence on his part and by the
      time that Aggie returned to the room, Zoie was wreathed in smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;Jimmy's going to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie looked at her sceptically. &ldquo;Goodness knows I hope so,&rdquo; she said,
      then added in despair, &ldquo;Look at your cheeks. They're flaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the powder puff was called into requisition, and Zoie turned a
      temporarily blanched face to Aggie. &ldquo;Is that better?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; answered Aggie, &ldquo;but how about your hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with it?&rdquo; asked Zoie. Her reflection betrayed a
      coiffure that might have turned Marie Antoinette green with envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would anybody think you'd been in bed for days?&rdquo; asked Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred likes it that way,&rdquo; was Zoie's defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; said Aggie, without deigning to argue the matter further.
      And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted
      curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, as she sprayed her white neck and
      arms with her favourite perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with the
      tips of her perfumed fingers. &ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; she cried in horror as she
      caught sight of her reflection. &ldquo;You're not going to put my hair in a
      pigtail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way invalids always have their hair,&rdquo; was Aggie's laconic
      reply, and she continued to plait the obstinate curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't have it like that!&rdquo; declared Zoie, and she shook herself free
      from Aggie's unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful
      pigtail. &ldquo;Alfred would leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're going to make a perfect fright of me,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, &ldquo;I just
      won't see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't coming to see YOU,&rdquo; reminded Aggie. &ldquo;He's coming to see the
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jimmy doesn't come soon, I'll not HAVE any baby,&rdquo; answered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get into bed,&rdquo; said Aggie, and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace
      coverlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did I put my cap?&rdquo; asked Zoie. Her eyes caught the small knot of
      lace and ribbons for which she was looking, and she pinned it on top of
      her saucy little curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In you go,&rdquo; said Aggie, motioning to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Zoie impressively, &ldquo;wait till I get my rose lights on the
      pillow.&rdquo; She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp; instantly
      the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glow&mdash;she studied
      the effect very carefully, then added a lingerie pillow to the two more
      formal ones, kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed. One more glance
      at the pillows, then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to fall
      &ldquo;carelessly&rdquo; outside the coverlet, threw one arm gracefully above her
      head, half-closed her eyes, and sank languidly back against her pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; she breathed faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Controlling her impulse to smile, Aggie crossed to the dressing-table with
      a business-like air and applied to Zoie's pink cheeks a third coating of
      powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze. &ldquo;Aggie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I just hate
      you when you act like that.&rdquo; But suddenly she was seized with a new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she mused as she looked across the room at the soft, pink sofa
      bathed in firelight, &ldquo;I wonder if I shouldn't look better on that couch
      under those roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary. &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; decided Zoie with a mischievous smile, &ldquo;I'll get Alfred to carry
      me to the couch. That way I can get my arms around his neck. And once you
      get your arms around a man's neck, you can MANAGE him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval. &ldquo;Now,
      don't you make too much fuss over Alfred,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;YOU'RE the one
      who's to do the forgiving. Don't forget that! What's more,&rdquo; she reminded
      Zoie, &ldquo;you're very, very weak.&rdquo; But before she had time to instruct Zoie
      further there was a sharp, quick ring at the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women glanced at each other inquiringly. The next instant a man's
      step was heard in the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she, Mary?&rdquo; demanded someone in a voice tense with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Alfred!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we haven't any baby!&rdquo; gasped Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; cried Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down,&rdquo; commanded Aggie, and Zoie had barely time to fall back limply
      on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the room.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Alfred entered Zoie's bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment.
      It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber. Through the dim rose
      light he could barely perceive his young wife. She was lying white and
      apparently lifeless on her pillows. He moved cautiously toward the bed,
      but Aggie raised a warning finger. Afraid to speak, he grasped Aggie's
      hand and searched her face for reassurance; she nodded toward Zoie, whose
      eyes were closed. He tiptoed to the bedside, sank on his knees and
      reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Alfred's intense surprise, his lips had barely touched Zoie's
      fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace. &ldquo;Alfred,
      Alfred!&rdquo; cried Zoie in delight; then she smothered his face with kisses.
      As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband, she caught the
      reproving eye of Aggie. With a weak little sigh, she relaxed her tenacious
      hold of Alfred, breathed his name very faintly, and sank back, apparently
      exhausted, upon her pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been too much for her,&rdquo; said the terrified young husband, and he
      glanced toward Aggie in anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pale she looks,&rdquo; added Alfred, as he surveyed the white face on the
      pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's so weak, poor dear,&rdquo; sympathised Aggie, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred nodded his understanding to Aggie. It was then that his attention
      was for the first time attracted toward the crib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. And again Zoie forgot Aggie's warning and sat
      straight up in bed. But Alfred did not see her. He was making determinedly
      for the crib, his heart beating high with the pride of possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette, Alfred stared at the empty
      bed in silence, then he quickly turned to the two anxious women. &ldquo;Where is
      he?&rdquo; he asked, his eyes wide with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie's lips opened to answer, but no words came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred's eyes turned to Aggie. The look on her face increased his worst
      fears. &ldquo;Don't tell me he's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he could not bring himself to
      utter the word. He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain Zoie again tried to answer. Aggie also made an unsuccessful
      attempt to speak. Then, driven to desperation by the strain of the
      situation, Zoie declared boldly: &ldquo;He's out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out?&rdquo; echoed Alfred in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Jimmy,&rdquo; explained Aggie, coming to Zoie's rescue as well as she knew
      how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; repeated Alfred in great astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for a breath of air,&rdquo; explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely
      regained her self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he very young to be out at night?&rdquo; asked Alfred with a puzzled
      frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We told Jimmy that,&rdquo; answered Aggie, amazed at the promptness with which
      each succeeding lie presented itself. &ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Jimmy
      is so crazy about the child that we can't do anything with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy crazy about my baby?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred incredulously. &ldquo;He always
      said babies were 'little red worms.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this one,&rdquo; answered Zoie sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; chimed in Aggie. &ldquo;He acts as though he owned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, DOES he?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred hotly. &ldquo;I'll soon put a stop to that,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;Where did he take him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly, then Aggie stammered
      evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, j-just downstairs&mdash;somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll LOOK j-just downstairs somewhere,&rdquo; decided Alfred, and he snatched
      up his hat and started toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred!&rdquo; cried Zoie in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back to her bedside to reassure her, Alfred was caught in a frantic
      embrace. &ldquo;I'll be back in a minute, dear,&rdquo; he said, but Zoie clung to him
      and pleaded desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't going to leave me the very first thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred hesitated. He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie, but the thought of
      Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not to
      be borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie renewed her efforts at persuasion. &ldquo;Now, dearie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wish
      you'd go get shaved and wash up a bit. I don't wish baby to see you
      looking so horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do, Alfred,&rdquo; insisted Aggie. &ldquo;He's sure to be here in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy won't care HOW his father looks,&rdquo; declared Alfred proudly, and
      Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three
      inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> care,&rdquo; persisted Zoie. &ldquo;First impressions are so important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Zoie,&rdquo; cautioned Aggie, as she crossed toward the bed with affected
      solicitude. &ldquo;You mustn't excite yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics, and
      again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman
      thoughtlessness, Alfred glanced at Aggie, uncertain as to how to repair
      the injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her have her own way,&rdquo; she whispered with a significant glance toward
      Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify that
      he would henceforth speak in hushed tones, then he tiptoed back to the bed
      and gently stroked the curls from Zoie's troubled forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, dear,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;lie still and rest and I'll go shave and
      wash up a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie sighed her acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he whispered to Aggie, &ldquo;you are to call me the moment my boy
      comes,&rdquo; and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold, than Zoie sat up in bed and
      called in a sharp whisper to Aggie, &ldquo;What's keeping them?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't imagine,&rdquo; answered Aggie, also in whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had Jimmy here,&rdquo; declared Zoie vindictively, &ldquo;I'd wring his little
      fat neck,&rdquo; and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers, she
      was about to get out of bed, when Aggie, who was facing Alfred's bedroom
      door, gave her a warning signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers, when Alfred
      re-entered the room in search of his satchel. Aggie found it for him
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoie's closed eyes. &ldquo;I'm so sorry,&rdquo; he
      apologised to Aggie, and again he slipped softly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Jimmy can't get the baby,&rdquo; whispered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, he'd have 'phoned,&rdquo; argued Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's 'phone to the Home,&rdquo; suggested Zoie, &ldquo;and find&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
      was interrupted by Alfred's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Aggie,&rdquo; called Alfred from the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; answered Aggie sweetly, and she crossed to the door and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't he come yet?&rdquo; called Alfred impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Alfred,&rdquo; said Aggie, and she closed the door very softly, lest
      Alfred should hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew Alfred could be so silly!&rdquo; snapped Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! sh!&rdquo; warned Aggie, and she glanced anxiously toward Alfred's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't care a bit about me!&rdquo; complained Zoie. &ldquo;It's all that horrid
      old baby that he's never seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jimmy doesn't come soon, he never WILL see it,&rdquo; declared Aggie, and
      she started toward the window to look out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a short quick ring of the bell. The two women glanced
      at each other with mingled hope and fear. Then their eyes sought the door
      expectantly.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the collar of his long ulster pushed high and the brim of his derby
      hat pulled low, Jimmy Jinks crept cautiously into the room. When he at
      length ceased to glance over his shoulder and came to a full stop, Aggie
      perceived a bit of white flannel hanging beneath the hem of his tightly
      buttoned coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've GOT it!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; demanded Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy stared at them as though stupefied, then glanced uneasily over his
      shoulder, to make sure that no one was pursuing him. Aggie unbuttoned his
      ulster, seized a wee mite wrapped in a large shawl, and clasped it to her
      bosom with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; she exclaimed, then crossed
      quickly to the bassinette and deposited her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, having thrown discretion to the wind, Zoie had hopped out
      of bed. As usual, her greeting to Jimmy was in the nature of a reproach.
      &ldquo;What kept you?&rdquo; she demanded crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Aggie, who was now bending over the crib. &ldquo;What made you
      so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; answered Jimmy hotly, &ldquo;if you two think you can do any better,
      you're welcome to the job,&rdquo; and with that he threw off his overcoat and
      sank sullenly on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! sh!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie and Aggie, simultaneously, and they glanced
      nervously toward Alfred's bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked at them without comprehending why he should &ldquo;sh.&rdquo; They did
      not bother to explain. Instead, Zoie turned her back upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see it,&rdquo; she said, peeping into the bassinette. And then with a
      little cry of disgust she again looked at Jimmy reproachfully. &ldquo;Isn't it
      ugly?&rdquo; she said. Jimmy's contempt for woman's ingratitude was too deep for
      words, and he only stared at her in injured silence. But his reflections
      were quickly upset when Alfred called from the next room, to inquire again
      about Baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred's here!&rdquo; whispered Jimmy, beginning to realise the meaning of the
      women's mysterious behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! sh!&rdquo; said Aggie again to Jimmy, and Zoie flew toward the bed, almost
      vaulting over the footboard in her hurry to get beneath the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present Alfred did not disturb them further. Apparently he was
      still occupied with his shaving, but just as Jimmy was about to ask for
      particulars, the 'phone rang. The three culprits glanced guiltily at each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; whispered Zoie in a frightened voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie crossed to the 'phone. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she called softly. &ldquo;The Children's
      Home?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy paused in the act of sitting and turned his round eyes toward the
      'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie's facial expression was not reassuring. &ldquo;But we can't,&rdquo; she was
      saying; &ldquo;that's impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; called Zoie across the foot of the bed, unable longer to
      endure the suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie did not answer. She was growing more and more excited. &ldquo;A thief!&rdquo;
       she cried wildly, over the 'phone. &ldquo;How dare you call my husband a thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was following the conversation with growing interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Aggie, then she left the receiver hanging by the
      cord and turned to the expectant pair behind her. &ldquo;It's the Children's
      Home,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;That awful woman says Jimmy STOLE her baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie as though such depravity on Jimmy's part were
      unthinkable. Then she looked at him accusingly, and asked in low, measured
      tones, &ldquo;DID you STEAL HER BABY, JIMMY?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you tell me to?&rdquo; asked Jimmy hotly. &ldquo;Not literally,&rdquo; corrected
      Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How else COULD I steal a baby?&rdquo; demanded Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie looked at the unfortunate creature as if she could strangle him, and
      Aggie addressed him with a threat in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the Superintendent says you've got to bring it straight back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see myself!&rdquo; said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sha'n't bring it back,&rdquo; declared Zoie. &ldquo;I'll not let him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I tell the Superintendent?&rdquo; asked Aggie, &ldquo;he's holding the
      wire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him he can't have it,&rdquo; answered Zoie, as though that were the end of
      the whole matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concluded Aggie, &ldquo;he says if Jimmy DOESN'T bring it back the
      mother's coming after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jimmy, he bolted for the door. Aggie caught him by the sleeve as he
      passed. &ldquo;Wait, Jimmy,&rdquo; she said peremptorily. There was a moment of awful
      indecision, then something approaching an idea came to Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the Superintendent that it isn't here,&rdquo; she whispered to Aggie
      across the footboard. &ldquo;Tell him that Jimmy hasn't got here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy, &ldquo;tell him I haven't got here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie nodded wisely and returned to the 'phone. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she called
      pleasantly; then proceeded to explain. &ldquo;Mr. Jinks hasn't got here yet.&rdquo;
       There was a pause, then she added in her most conciliatory tone, &ldquo;I'll
      tell him what you say when he comes in.&rdquo; Another pause, and she hung up
      the receiver with a most gracious good-bye and turned to the others with
      increasing misgivings. &ldquo;He says he won't be responsible for that mother
      much longer&mdash;she's half-crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right has she to be crazy?&rdquo; demanded Zoie in an abused voice. &ldquo;She's
      a widow. She doesn't need a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; decided Aggie after careful deliberation, &ldquo;you'd better take it
      back, Jimmy, before Alfred sees it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie in protest. And again Jimmy bolted, but again he
      failed to reach the door.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      His face covered with lather, and a shaving brush in one hand, Alfred
      entered the room just as his friend was about to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; exclaimed the excited young father, &ldquo;you're back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; admitted Jimmy nervously, &ldquo;I'm back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; cried Alfred, and he glanced toward the crib. &ldquo;He's here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; agreed Aggie uneasily, as she tried to place herself
      between Alfred and the bassinette. &ldquo;He's here, but you mayn't have him,
      Alfred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, trying to put her out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; protested Aggie, &ldquo;not just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him to me,&rdquo; demanded Alfred, and thrusting Aggie aside, he took
      possession of the small mite in the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, Alfred,&rdquo; pleaded Aggie, &ldquo;your face. You'll get him all
      wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred did not heed her. He was bending over the cradle in an ecstasy. &ldquo;My
      boy!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my boy!&rdquo; Lifting the baby in his arms he circled the room
      cooing to him delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he away from home when his fadder came? Oh, me, oh, my! Coochy!
      Coochy! Coochy!&rdquo; Suddenly he remembered to whom he owed this wondrous
      treasure and forgetful of the lather on his unshaven face he rushed toward
      Zoie with an overflowing heart. &ldquo;My precious!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and he
      covered her cheek with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; cried Zoie in disgust and she pushed Alfred from her and
      brushed the hateful lather from her little pink check.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred was not to be robbed of his exaltation, and again he circled
      the room, making strange gurgling sounds to Baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did a horrid old Jimmy take him away from fadder?&rdquo; he said
      sympathetically, in the small person's ear; and he glanced at Jimmy with
      frowning disapproval. &ldquo;I'd just like to see him get you away from me
      again!&rdquo; he added to Baby, as he tickled the mite's ear with the end of his
      shaving brush. &ldquo;Oh, me! oh, my!&rdquo; he exclaimed in trepidation, as he
      perceived a bit of lather on the infant's cheek. Then lifting the boy high
      in his arms and throwing out his chest with great pride, he looked at
      Jimmy with an air of superiority. &ldquo;I guess I'm bad, aye?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy positively blushed. As for Zoie, she was growing more and more
      impatient for a little attention to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rock-a-bye, Baby,&rdquo; sang Alfred in strident tones and he swung the child
      high in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Alfred as though hypnotised. They kept time to
      his lullaby out of sheer nervousness. Suddenly Alfred stopped, held the
      child from him and gazed at it in horror. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
      The others waited breathlessly. &ldquo;Look at that baby's face,&rdquo; commanded
      Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie and Aggie exchanged alarmed glances, then Zoie asked in trepidation,
      &ldquo;What's the matter with his face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got a fever,&rdquo; declared Alfred. And he started toward the bed to show
      the child to its mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; shrieked Zoie, waving Alfred off in wild alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Alfred, backing from her in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie crossed quickly to Alfred's side and looked over his shoulder at the
      boy. &ldquo;I don't see anything wrong with its face,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's scarlet!&rdquo; persisted Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jimmy with a superior air, &ldquo;they're always like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; snorted Alfred, and he glared at Jimmy
      threateningly. &ldquo;You've frozen the child parading him around the streets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have him, Alfred,&rdquo; begged Aggie sweetly; &ldquo;I'll put him in his crib
      and keep him warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly Alfred released the boy. His eyes followed him to the crib
      with anxiety. &ldquo;Where's his nurse?&rdquo; he asked, as he glanced first from one
      to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie and Jimmy stared about the room as though expecting the desired
      person to drop from the ceiling. Then Zoie turned upon her unwary
      accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; she called in a threatening tone, &ldquo;where IS his nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Jimmy take the nurse out, too?&rdquo; demanded Alfred, more and more
      annoyed by the privileges Jimmy had apparently been usurping in his
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about the nurse,&rdquo; interposed Aggie. &ldquo;Baby likes me better
      anyway. I'll tuck him in,&rdquo; and she bent fondly over the crib, but Alfred
      was not to be so easily pacified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; he exclaimed excitedly, &ldquo;that my boy hasn't any
      nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We HAD a nurse,&rdquo; corrected Zoie, &ldquo;but&mdash;but I had to discharge her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred glanced from one to the other for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discharge her?&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was crazy,&rdquo; stammered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred's eyes sought Aggie's for confirmation. She nodded. He directed his
      steady gaze toward Jimmy. The latter jerked his head up and down in
      nervous assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Alfred, amazed at their apparent lack of resource, &ldquo;why
      didn't you get ANOTHER nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie is going to stay and take care of baby to-night,&rdquo; declared Zoie,
      and then she beamed upon Aggie as only she knew how. &ldquo;Aren't you, dear?&rdquo;
       she asked sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; answered Aggie, studiously avoiding Jimmy's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby is going to sleep in the spare room with Aggie and Jimmy,&rdquo; said
      Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, too desperate to care what Alfred might infer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignoring Jimmy's implied protest, Zoie continued sweetly to Alfred:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don't worry, dear; go back to your room and finish your shaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish shaving?&rdquo; repeated Alfred in a puzzled way. Then his hand went
      mechanically to his cheek and he stared at Zoie in astonishment. &ldquo;By
      Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I had forgotten all about it. That shows you how
      excited I am.&rdquo; And with a reluctant glance toward the cradle, he went
      quickly from the room, singing a high-pitched lullaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the three conspirators were drawing together for consultation,
      Alfred returned to the room. It was apparent that there was something
      important on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, glancing from one to another, &ldquo;I forgot to ask&mdash;what's
      his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conspirators looked at each other without answering. To Alfred their
      delay was annoying. Of course his son had been given his father's name,
      but he wished to HEAR someone say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby's, I mean,&rdquo; he explained impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy felt instinctively that Zoie's eyes were upon him. He avoided her
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; called Zoie, meaning only to appeal to him for a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; thundered the infuriated Alfred. &ldquo;You've called my boy 'Jimmy'?
      Why 'Jimmy'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once Zoie was without an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After waiting in vain for any response, Alfred advanced upon the
      uncomfortable Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be very popular around here,&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and studied the pattern
      of the rug upon which he was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After what seemed an age to Jimmy, Alfred turned his back upon his old
      friend and started toward his bedroom. Jimmy peeped out uneasily from his
      long eyelashes. When Alfred reached the threshold, he faced about quickly
      and stared again at Jimmy for an explanation. It seemed to Jimmy that
      Alfred's nostrils were dilating. He would not have been surprised to see
      Alfred snort fire. He let his eyes fall before the awful spectacle of his
      friend's wrath. Alfred's upper lip began to curl. He cast a last withering
      look in Jimmy's direction, retired quickly from the scene and banged the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jimmy again had the courage to lift his eyes he was confronted by the
      contemptuous gaze of Zoie, who was sitting up in bed and regarding him
      with undisguised disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell him what the baby's name is?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do <i>I</i> know what the baby's name is?&rdquo; retorted Jimmy savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! sh!&rdquo; cautioned Aggie as she glanced nervously toward the door through
      which Alfred had just passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter WHAT the baby's name is so long as we have to send it
      back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll NOT send it back,&rdquo; declared Zoie emphatically, &ldquo;at least not until
      morning. That will give Jimmy a whole night to get another one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another!&rdquo; shrieked Jimmy. &ldquo;See here, you two can't be changing babies
      every five minutes without Alfred knowing it. Even HE has SOME sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; answered Aggie shortly. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that all
      young babies look just alike. Their own mothers couldn't tell them apart,
      if it weren't for their clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where can we GET another?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Aggie could answer, Alfred was again heard calling from the next
      room. Apparently all his anger had subsided, for he inquired in the most
      amiable tone as to what baby might be doing and how he might be feeling.
      Aggie crossed quickly to the door, and sweetly reassured the anxious
      father, then she closed the door softly and turned to Zoie and Jimmy with
      a new inspiration lighting her face. &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; she exclaimed
      ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy regarded his spouse with grave suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;every time YOU 'HAVE IT,' I DO IT. The NEXT
      time you 'HAVE IT' YOU DO IT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis with which Jimmy made his declaration deserved consideration,
      but to his amazement it was entirely ignored by both women. Hopping
      quickly out of bed, without even glancing in his direction, Zoie gave her
      entire attention to Aggie. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be OTHER babies' Homes,&rdquo; said Aggie, and she glanced at Jimmy
      from her superior height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They aren't open all night like corner drug stores,&rdquo; growled Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they ought to be,&rdquo; decided Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And surely,&rdquo; argued Aggie, &ldquo;in an extraordinary case&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was an 'extraordinary case,'&rdquo; declared Jimmy, &ldquo;and you saw what
      happened this time, and the Superintendent is a friend of mine&mdash;at
      least he WAS a friend of mine.&rdquo; And with that Jimmy sat himself down on
      the far corner of the couch and proceeded to ruminate on the havoc that
      these two women had wrought in his once tranquil life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie gazed at Jimmy in deep disgust; her friend Aggie had made an
      excellent suggestion, and instead of acting upon it with alacrity, here
      sat Jimmy sulking like a stubborn child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Zoie, as her eyebrows assumed a bored angle, &ldquo;there are
      SOME babies in the world outside of Children's Homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; was Aggie's enthusiastic rejoinder; &ldquo;there's one born every
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was born BETWEEN minutes,&rdquo; protested Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's talking about you?&rdquo; snapped Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Aggie exclaimed that she &ldquo;had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got it twice as bad,&rdquo; groaned Jimmy, and he wondered what new form
      her persecution of him was about to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the morning paper?&rdquo; asked Aggie, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't advertise NOW,&rdquo; protested Zoie. &ldquo;It's too late for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Sh!&rdquo; answered Aggie, as she snatched the paper quickly from the table
      and began running her eyes up and down its third page. &ldquo;Married&mdash;married,&rdquo;
       she murmured, and then with delight she found the half column for which
      she was searching. &ldquo;Born,&rdquo; she exclaimed triumphantly. &ldquo;Here we are! Get a
      pencil, Zoie, and we'll take down all the new ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Zoie, clapping her hands in glee, &ldquo;and Jimmy can get a
      taxi and look them right up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, CAN he?&rdquo; shouted Jimmy as he rose with clenched fists. &ldquo;Now you two,
      see here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Jimmy could complete his threat, there was a sharp ring of the door
      bell. He looked at the two women inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the mother,&rdquo; cried Zoie in a hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother!&rdquo; repeated Jimmy in terror and he glanced uncertainly from one
      door to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cover up the baby!&rdquo; called Zoie, and drawing Jimmy's overcoat quickly
      from his arm, Aggie threw it hurriedly over the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Jimmy remained motionless in the centre of the room,
      hatless, coatless, and shorn of ideas. A loud knock on the door decided
      him and he sank with trembling knees behind the nearest armchair, just as
      Zoie made a flying leap into the bed and prepared to draw the cover over
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knock was repeated and Aggie signalled to Zoie to answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; called Zoie very faintly.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      From his hiding-place Jimmy peeped around the edge of the armchair and saw
      what seemed to be a large clothes basket entering the room. Closer
      inspection revealed the small figure of Maggie, the washerwoman's
      daughter, propelling the basket, which was piled high with freshly
      laundered clothing. Jimmy drew a long sigh of relief, and unknotted his
      cramped limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I lay the things on the sofa, mum?&rdquo; asked Maggie as she placed her
      basket on the floor and waited for Zoie's instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; answered Zoie, too exhausted for further comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the laundry piece by piece from the basket, Maggie made excuses for
      its delay, while she placed it on the couch. Deaf to Maggie's chatter,
      Zoie lay back languidly on her pillows; but she soon heard something that
      lifted her straight up in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me mother is sorry she had to kape you waitin' this week,&rdquo; said Maggie
      over her shoulder; &ldquo;but we've got twins at OUR house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twins!&rdquo; echoed Zoie and Aggie simultaneously. Then together they stared
      at Maggie as though she had been dropped from another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding attention temporarily diverted from himself, Jimmy had begun to
      rearrange both his mind and his cravat when he felt rather than saw that
      his two persecutors were regarding him with a steady, determined gaze. In
      spite of himself, Jimmy raised his eyes to theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twins!&rdquo; was their laconic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Jimmy had heard Maggie's announcement about the bountiful supply of
      offspring lately arrived at her house, but not until he caught the
      fanatical gleam in the eyes of his companions did he understand the part
      they meant him to play in their next adventure. He waited for no
      explanation&mdash;he bolted toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Jimmy,&rdquo; commanded Aggie. But it was not until she had laid firm
      hold of him that he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised by such strange behaviour on the part of those whom she
      considered her superiors, Maggie looked first at Aggie, then at Jimmy,
      then at Zoie, uncertain whether to go or to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anythin' to go back, mum?&rdquo; she stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie stared at Maggie solemnly from across the foot of the bed. &ldquo;Maggie,&rdquo;
       she asked in a deep, sepulchral tone, &ldquo;where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just around the corner on High Street, mum,&rdquo; gasped Maggie. Then, keeping
      her eyes fixed uneasily on Zoie she picked up her basket and backed
      cautiously toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; commanded Zoie; and Maggie paused, one foot in mid-air. &ldquo;Wait in
      the hall,&rdquo; said Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'um,&rdquo; assented Maggie, almost in a whisper. Then she nodded her head
      jerkily, cast another furtive glance at the three persons who were
      regarding her so strangely, and slipped quickly through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having crossed the room and stealthily closed the door, Aggie returned to
      Jimmy, who was watching her with the furtive expression of a trapped
      animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Providence,&rdquo; she declared, with a grave countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked up at Aggie with affected innocence, then rolled his round
      eyes away from her. He was confronted by Zoie, who had approached from the
      opposite side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Fate,&rdquo; declared Zoie, in awe-struck tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was beginning to wriggle, but he kept up a last desperate presence
      of not understanding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't tell me I'm going to take the wash to the old lady,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;for I'm not going to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't the WASH,&rdquo; said Aggie, and her tone warned him that she expected
      no nonsense from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what we are thinking about just as well as we do,&rdquo; said Zoie.
      &ldquo;I'll write that washerwoman a note and tell her we must have one of those
      babies right now.&rdquo; And with that she turned toward her desk and began
      rummaging amongst her papers for a pencil and pad. &ldquo;The luck of these
      poor,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The luck of US,&rdquo; corrected Aggie, whose spirits were now soaring. Then
      she turned to Jimmy with growing enthusiasm. &ldquo;Just think of it, dear,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;Fate has sent us a baby to our very door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; declared Jimmy, again beginning to show signs of fight, &ldquo;if Fate
      has sent a baby to the door, you don't need me,&rdquo; and with that he snatched
      his coat from the crib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Jimmy,&rdquo; again commanded Aggie, and she took his coat gently but
      firmly from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; argued Jimmy, trying to get free from his strong-minded
      spouse, &ldquo;you know perfectly well that that washerwoman isn't going to let
      us have that baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; called Zoie over her shoulder, while she scribbled a hurried
      note to the washerwoman. &ldquo;If she won't let us have it 'for keeps,' I'll
      just 'rent it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy in genuine horror. &ldquo;Warm, fresh, palpitating
      babies rented as you would rent a gas stove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all a pose,&rdquo; declared Aggie, in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;You think
      babies 'little red worms,' you've said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy could not deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be only too glad to rent it,&rdquo; declared Zoie, as she glanced
      hurriedly through the note just written, and slipped it, together with a
      bill, into an envelope. &ldquo;I'll pay her anything. It's only until I can get
      another one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another!&rdquo; shouted Jimmy, and his eyes turned heavenward for help. &ldquo;An
      endless chain with me to put the links together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so theatrical,&rdquo; said Aggie, irritably, as she took up Jimmy's
      coat and prepared to get him into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why DO you make such a fuss about NOTHING,&rdquo; sighed Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; echoed Jimmy, and he looked at her with wondering eyes. &ldquo;I
      crawl about like a thief in the night snatching babies from their mother's
      breasts, and you call THAT nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't have to 'CRAWL,'&rdquo; reminded Zoie, &ldquo;you can take a taxi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your coat, dear,&rdquo; said Aggie graciously, as she endeavoured to
      slip Jimmy's limp arms into the sleeves of the garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take Maggie with you,&rdquo; said Zoie, with the air of conferring a
      distinct favour upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the wash on my lap,&rdquo; added Jimmy sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Zoie, unruffled by Jimmy's ungracious behaviour. &ldquo;We'll send
      the wash later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very kind of you,&rdquo; sneered Jimmy, as he unconsciously allowed his
      arms to slip into the sleeves of the coat Aggie was urging upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you need to do,&rdquo; said Aggie complacently, &ldquo;is to get us the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;and what do you suppose my friends would say if they
      were to see me riding around town with the wash-lady's daughter and a baby
      on my lap? What would YOU say?&rdquo; he asked Aggie, &ldquo;if you didn't know the
      facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody's going to see you,&rdquo; answered Aggie impatiently; &ldquo;it's only around
      the corner. Go on, Jimmy, be a good boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean a good thing,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy without budging from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie; &ldquo;it's as easy as can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the FIRST one SOUNDED easy, too,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have to do,&rdquo; explained Zoie, trying to restrain her rising
      intolerance of his stupidity, &ldquo;is to give this note to Maggie's mother.
      She'll give you her baby, you bring it back here, we'll give you THIS one,
      and you can take it right back to the Home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meet the other mother,&rdquo; concluded Jimmy with a shake of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a distinct threat in Zoie's voice when she again addressed the
      stubborn Jimmy and the glitter of triumph was in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better meet here THERE than HERE,&rdquo; she warned him; &ldquo;you know what
      the Superintendent said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; agreed Aggie with an anxious face. &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; she pleaded,
      &ldquo;it will only take a minute; you can do the whole thing before you have
      had time to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I have had time to think,&rdquo; repeated Jimmy excitedly. &ldquo;That's how
      you get me to do everything. Well, this time I've HAD time to think and I
      don't think I will!&rdquo; and with that he threw himself upon the couch,
      unmindful of the damage to the freshly laundered clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; cried Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't time to sit down,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll TAKE time,&rdquo; declared Jimmy. His eyes blinked ominously and he
      remained glued to the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence; the two women gazed at Jimmy in despair.
      Remembering a fresh grievance, Jimmy turned upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you two know that I haven't had anything to eat
      yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; said Zoie, &ldquo;that Alfred may be back at any minute? He
      can't stay away forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless he has cut his throat,&rdquo; rejoined Jimmy, &ldquo;and that's what I'd
      do if I had a razor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie regarded Jimmy as though he were beyond redemption. &ldquo;Can't you ever
      think of anybody but yourself?&rdquo; she asked, with a martyred air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Jimmy been half his age, Aggie would have felt sure that she saw him
      make a face at her friend for answer. As it was, she resolved to make one
      last effort to awaken her unobliging spouse to a belated sense of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you might better get the washerwoman's baby
      than to go from house to house for one,&rdquo; and she glanced again toward the
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; urged Zoie, &ldquo;and that's just what you'll HAVE to do, if you don't
      get this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's head hung dejectedly. It was apparent that his courage was
      slipping from him. Aggie was quick to realise her opportunity, and before
      Jimmy could protect himself from her treacherous wiles, she had slipped
      one arm coyly about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jimmy,&rdquo; she pleaded as she pressed her soft cheek to his throbbing
      temple, and toyed with the bay curl on his perspiring forehead, &ldquo;wont you
      do this little teeny-weepy thing just for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's lips puckered in a pout; he began to blink nervously. Aggie
      slipped her other arm about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she continued with a baby whine, &ldquo;I got Zoie into this, and
      I've just got to get her out of it. You're not going to desert me, are
      you, Jimmy? You WILL help me, won't you, dear?&rdquo; Her breath was on Jimmy's
      cheek; he could feel her lips stealing closer to his. He had not been
      treated to much affection of late. His head drooped lower&mdash;he began
      to twiddle the fob on his watch chain. &ldquo;Won't you?&rdquo; persisted Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy studied the toes of his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you?&rdquo; she repeated, and her soft eyelashes just brushed the tip of
      his retrousee nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's head was now wagging from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you?&rdquo; she entreated a fourth time, and she kissed him full on the
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a resigned sigh, Jimmy rose mechanically from the heap of crushed
      laundry and held out his fat chubby hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the letter,&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said Zoie, taking Jimmy's acquiescence as a matter of
      course; and she thrust the letter into the pocket of Jimmy's ulster. &ldquo;Now,
      when you get back with the baby,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;don't come in all of a
      sudden; just wait outside and whistle. You CAN WHISTLE, can't you?&rdquo; she
      asked with a doubtful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Jimmy placed two fingers between his lips and produced a
      shrill whistle that made both Zoie and Aggie glance nervously toward
      Alfred's bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can WHISTLE,&rdquo; admitted Zoie, then she continued her directions.
      &ldquo;If Alfred is not in the room, I'll raise the shade and you can come right
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he is in the room?&rdquo; asked Jimmy with a fine shade of sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he IS in the room,&rdquo; explained Zoie, &ldquo;you must wait outside until I can
      get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy turned his eyes toward Aggie to ask if it were possible that she
      still approved of Zoie's inhuman plan. For answer Aggie stroked his coat
      collar fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give you the signal the moment the coast is clear,&rdquo; she said, then
      she hurriedly buttoned Jimmy's large ulster and wound a muffler about his
      neck. &ldquo;There now, dear, do go, you're all buttoned up,&rdquo; and with that she
      urged him toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; protested Jimmy, as he paused on the threshold. &ldquo;Let me
      get this right, if the shade is up, I stay down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; corrected Aggie and Zoie in a breath. &ldquo;If the shade is up,
      you come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy cast another martyred look in Zoie's direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't hurry will you?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know it is only twenty-three
      below zero and I haven't had anything to eat yet&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we know,&rdquo; interrupted the two women in chorus, and then Aggie added
      wearily, &ldquo;go on, Jimmy; don't be funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny?&rdquo; snorted Jimmy. &ldquo;With a baby on my lap and the wash lady's
      daughter, I won't be funny, oh no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether Jimmy would not have worked himself into another
      state of open rebellion had not Aggie put an end to his protests by
      thrusting him firmly out of the room and closing the door behind him.
      After this act of heroic decision on her part, the two women listened
      intently, fearing that he might return; but presently they heard the bang
      of the outer door, and at last they drew a long breath of relief. For the
      first time since Alfred's arrival, Aggie was preparing to sink into a
      chair, when she was startled by a sharp exclamation from Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; cried Zoie, &ldquo;I forgot to ask Maggie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her what?&rdquo; questioned Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys or girls,&rdquo; said Zoie, with a solemn look toward the door through
      which Jimmy had just disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; decided Aggie, after a moment's reflection, &ldquo;it's too late now.
      Anyway,&rdquo; she concluded philosophically, &ldquo;we couldn't CHANGE it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      With more or less damage to himself consequent on his excitement, Alfred
      completed his shaving and hastened to return to his wife and the babe.
      Finding the supposedly ill Zoie careering about the centre of the room
      expostulating with Aggie, the young man stopped dumbfounded on the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoie,&rdquo; he cried in astonishment. &ldquo;What are you doing out of bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the startled Zoie gazed at him stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes sought Aggie's for a suggestion;
      there was no answer there. It was not until her gaze fell upon the cradle
      that she was seized by the desired inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just got up to see baby,&rdquo; she faltered, then putting one hand giddily
      to her head, she pretended to sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Alfred's arms were about her. He bore her quickly to the
      bed. &ldquo;You stay here, my darling,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;I'll bring baby to
      you,&rdquo; and after a solicitous caress he turned toward baby's crib and bent
      fondly over the little one. &ldquo;Ah, there's father's man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Was he
      lonesome baby? Oh, goodis g'acious,&rdquo; then followed an incoherent muttering
      of baby talk, as he bore the youngster toward Zoie's bed. &ldquo;Come, my
      precious,&rdquo; he called to Zoie, as he sank down on the edge of the bed. &ldquo;See
      mother's boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; shrieked Zoie in horror. It had suddenly dawned upon her that
      this was the name by which Alfred would no doubt call her for the rest of
      her life. She almost detested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred did not see the look of disgust on Zoie's face. He was wholly
      absorbed by baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a funny face,&rdquo; he cooed as he pinched the youngster's cheek. &ldquo;Great
      Scott, what a grip,&rdquo; he cried as the infant's fingers closed around his
      own. &ldquo;Will you look at the size of those hands,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie and Aggie exchanged worried glances; the baby had no doubt inherited
      his large hands from his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Aggie,&rdquo; called Alfred, &ldquo;what are all of these little specks on
      baby's forehead?&rdquo; He pointed toward the infant's brow. &ldquo;One, two, three,&rdquo;
       he counted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie was becoming more and more uncomfortable at the close proximity of
      the little stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Aggie, with affected carelessness as she leaned over Alfred's
      shoulder and glanced at baby's forehead. &ldquo;That is just a little rash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rash!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred excitedly, &ldquo;that's dangerous, isn't it? We'd
      better call up the doctor.&rdquo; And he rose and started hurriedly toward the
      telephone, baby in arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly,&rdquo; called Zoie, filled with vague alarm at the thought of
      the family physician's appearance and the explanations that this might
      entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping between Alfred and the 'phone, Aggie protested frantically. &ldquo;You
      see, Alfred,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is better to have the rash OUT, it won't do
      any harm unless it turns IN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's perfectly well,&rdquo; declared Zoie, &ldquo;if you'll only put him in his crib
      and leave him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred looked down at his charge. &ldquo;Is that right, son?&rdquo; he asked, and he
      tickled the little fellow playfully in the ribs. &ldquo;I'll tell you what,&rdquo; he
      called over his shoulder to Zoie, &ldquo;he's a fine looking boy.&rdquo; And then with
      a mysterious air, he nodded to Aggie to approach. &ldquo;Whom does he look
      like?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Zoie sat up in anxiety. Aggie glanced at her, uncertain what answer
      to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hadn't thought,&rdquo; she stammered weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, go on,&rdquo; exclaimed the proud young father, &ldquo;you can't tell me that
      you can look at that boy and not see the resemblance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; asked Aggie, half fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;he's the image of Zoie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie gazed at the puckered red face in Alfred's arms. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she shrieked
      in disgust, then fall back on her pillows and drew the lace coverlet over
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistaking Zoie's feeling for one of embarrassment at being over-praised,
      Alfred bore the infant to her bedside. &ldquo;See, dear,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;see for
      yourself, look at his forehead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather look at you,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, peeping from beneath the coverlet,
      &ldquo;if you would only put that thing down for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thing?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, as though doubting his own ears. But before he
      could remonstrate further, Zoie's arms were about his neck and she was
      pleading jealously for his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Alfred,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;I have scarcely had a look at you, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred shook his head and turned to baby with an indulgent smile. It was
      pleasant to have two such delightful creatures bidding for his entire
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; he said to baby. &ldquo;Dear me, tink of mudder wanting to look at a
      big u'gy t'ing like fadder, when she could look at a 'itty witty t'ing
      like dis,&rdquo; and he rose and crossed to the crib where he deposited the
      small creature with yet more gurgling and endearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie's dreams of rapture at Alfred's home coming had not included such
      divided attention as he was now showing her and she was growing more and
      more desperate at the turn affairs had taken. She resolved to put a stop
      to his nonsense and to make him realise that she and no one else was the
      lode star of his existence. She beckoned to Aggie to get out of the room
      and to leave her a clear field and as soon as her friend had gone quietly
      into the next room, she called impatiently to Alfred who was still cooing
      rapturously over the young stranger. Finding Alfred deaf to her first
      entreaty, Zoie shut her lips hard, rearranged her pretty head-dress, drew
      one fascinating little curl down over her shoulder, reknotted the pink
      ribbon of her negligee, and then issued a final and imperious order for
      her husband to attend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, dear,&rdquo; answered Alfred, with a shade of impatience. &ldquo;I'm
      coming, I'm coming.&rdquo; And bidding a reluctant farewell to the small person
      in the crib, he crossed to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie caught Alfred's hand and drew him down to her; he smiled
      complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said in the patronising tone that Zoie always resented. &ldquo;How is
      hubby's little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about time,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, &ldquo;that you made a little fuss over me for a
      change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own!&rdquo; murmured Alfred. He stooped to kiss the eager lips, but just as
      his young wife prepared to lend herself to his long delayed embrace, his
      mind was distracted by an uneasy thought. &ldquo;Do you think that Baby is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not permitted to finish the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie drew him back to her with a sharp exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of ME for a while,&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; expostulated Alfred with a shade of surprise at her
      vehemence. &ldquo;How could I think of anyone else?&rdquo; Again he stooped to embrace
      her and again his mind was directed otherwise. &ldquo;I wonder if Baby is warm
      enough,&rdquo; he said and attempted to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder about ME for a while,&rdquo; snapped Zoie, clinging to him determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Alfred looked at her in amazement. Was it possible there was
      anything besides Baby worth wondering about? Whether there was or not,
      Zoie was no longer to be resisted and with a last regretful look at the
      crib, he resigned himself to giving his entire attention to his spoiled
      young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratified by her hard-won conquest, Zoie now settled herself in Alfred's
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't told me what you did all the time that you were away,&rdquo; she
      reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there was plenty to do,&rdquo; answered Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think of me every minute?&rdquo; she asked jealously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be telling,&rdquo; laughed Alfred, as he pinched her small pink ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to be 'told,'&rdquo; declared Zoie; &ldquo;I don't suppose you realise it, but
      if I were to live a THOUSAND YEARS, I'd never be quite sure what you did
      during those FEW MONTHS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nothing that you wouldn't have been proud of,&rdquo; answered Alfred,
      with an unconscious expansion of his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me as much as ever?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave yourself,&rdquo; answered Alfred, trying not to appear flattered by the
      discovery that his absence had undoubtedly caused her great uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, SAY it!&rdquo; demanded Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I do,&rdquo; answered Alfred, with the diffidence of a school boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then kiss me,&rdquo; concluded Zoie, with an air of finality that left Alfred
      no alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Alfred was no longer seeking an alternative. He was
      again under the spell of his wife's adorable charms and he kissed her not
      once, but many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish child,&rdquo; he murmured, then he laid her tenderly against the large
      white pillows, remonstrating with her for being so spoiled, and cautioning
      her to be a good little girl while he went again to see about Baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie clung to his hand and feigned approaching tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't thinking of me at all?&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;And kisses are no good
      unless you put your whole mind on them. Give me a real kiss!&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Alfred stooped to humour the small importunate person who was so
      jealous of his every thought, but just as his lips touched her forehead
      his ear was arrested by a sound as yet new both to him and to Zoie. He
      lifted his head and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered Zoie, wondering if the cat could have got into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A redoubled effort on the part of the young stranger directed their
      attention in the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred tragically, &ldquo;it's Baby. He's crying.&rdquo; And with
      that, he rushed to the crib and clasped the small mite close to his
      breast, leaving Zoie to pummel the pillows in an agony of vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After vain cajoling of the angry youngster, Alfred bore him excitedly to
      Zoie's bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better take him, dear,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the young husband's astonishment, Zoie waved him from her in terror,
      and called loudly for Aggie. But no sooner had Aggie appeared on the
      scene, than a sharp whistle was heard from the pavement below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull down the shade!&rdquo; cried Zoie frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie hastened toward the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attributing Zoie's uneasiness to a caprice of modesty, Alfred turned from
      the cradle to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can see in way up here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Zoie's distress, the lowering of the shade was answered by a yet
      shriller whistle from the street below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it 'up' or 'down'?&rdquo; cried Zoie to Aggie in an agony of doubt, as she
      tried to recall her instructions to Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered Aggie. &ldquo;I've forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another impatient whistle did not improve their memory. Alarmed by Zoie's
      increasing excitement, and thinking she was troubled merely by a sick
      woman's fancy that someone might see through the window, Alfred placed the
      babe quickly in its cradle and crossed to the young wife's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was up, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had Aggie put it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I want it up,&rdquo; declared the seemingly perverse Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was up,&rdquo; argued Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      A succession of emotional whistles set Zoie to pounding the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it down!&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Zoie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say 'up' or did I say 'down'?&rdquo; moaned the half-demented Zoie, while
      long whistles and short whistles, appealing whistles and impatient
      whistles followed each other in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said down, dear,&rdquo; persisted Alfred, now almost as distracted as his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie waved him from the room. &ldquo;I wish you'd get out of here,&rdquo; she cried;
      &ldquo;you make me so nervous that I can't think at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dear,&rdquo; murmured Alfred, &ldquo;if you wish it.&rdquo; And with a hurt and
      perplexed expression on his face he backed quickly from the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Zoie's letter asking for the O'Flarety twin had reached that young
      lady's astonished mother, Mrs. O'Flarety felt herself suddenly lifted to a
      position of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the purty Mrs. Hardy a wantin' my little Bridget,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, and she began to dwell upon the romantic possibilities of her
      offspring's future under the care of such a &ldquo;foine stylish lady and
      concluded by declaring it 'a lucky day entoirely.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy had his misgivings about it being Bridget's &ldquo;LUCKY day,&rdquo; but it was
      not for him to delay matters by dwelling upon the eccentricities of Zoie's
      character, and when Mrs. O'Flarety had deposited Bridget in Jimmy's short
      arms and slipped a well filled nursing bottle into his overcoat pocket, he
      took his leave hastily, lest the excited woman add Bridget's twin to her
      willing offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once out of sight of the elated mother, Jimmy thrust the defenceless
      Bridget within the folds of his already snug ulster, buttoned the garment
      in such places as it would meet, and made for the taxi which, owing to the
      upset condition of the street, he had been obliged to abandon at the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the driver had obtained a more promising &ldquo;fare&rdquo; or been run in by
      the police, Jimmy never knew. At any rate it was in vain that he looked
      for his vehicle. So intense was the cold that it was impossible to wait
      for a chance taxi; furthermore, the meanness of the district made it
      extremely unlikely that one would appear, and glancing guiltily behind him
      to make sure that no one was taking cognisance of his strange exploit,
      Jimmy began picking his way along dark lanes and avoiding the lighted
      thoroughfare on which the &ldquo;Sherwood&rdquo; was situated, until he was within a
      block of his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panting with haste and excitement, he eventually gained courage to dash
      through a side street that brought him within a few doors of the
      &ldquo;Sherwood.&rdquo; Again glancing behind him, he turned the well lighted corner
      and arrived beneath Zoie's window to find one shade up and one down. In
      his perplexity he emitted a faint whistle. Immediately he saw the other
      shade lowered. Uncertain as to what arrangement he had actually made with
      Zoie, he ventured a second whistle. The result was a hysterical running up
      and down of the shade which left him utterly bewildered as to what
      disposition he was supposed to make of the wobbly bit of humanity pressed
      against his shirt front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching over his artificially curved figure to grasp a bit of white that
      trailed below his coat, he looked up to see a passing policeman eyeing him
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taking the air?&rdquo; asked the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes,&rdquo; mumbled Jimmy with affected nonchalence and he knocked the heels
      of his boots together in order to keep his teeth from chattering. &ldquo;It's a
      fi-fine ni-night for air,&rdquo; he stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said the policeman, and to Jimmy's horror, he saw the fellow's
      eyes fix themselves on the bit of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go-good-night,&rdquo; stammered Jimmy hurriedly, and trying to assume an easy
      stride in spite of the uncomfortable addition to his already rotund
      figure, he slipped into the hotel, where avoiding the lighted elevator, he
      laboured quickly, up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment when Zoie was driving Alfred in consternation from the
      room, Jimmy entered it uninvited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; was the inhospitable greeting received simultaneously from Zoie
      and Aggie, and without waiting for further instructions he &ldquo;got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for all concerned, Alfred, who was at the same moment
      departing by way of the bedroom door, did not look behind him; but it was
      some minutes before Aggie who had followed Jimmy into the hall could
      persuade him to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      After repeated and insistent signals both from Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy's
      round red face appeared cautiously around the frame of the door. It bore
      unmistakable indications of apoplexy. But the eyes of the women were not
      upon Jimmy's face, they too had caught sight of the bit of white that hung
      below his coat, and dragging him quickly into the room and closing the
      door, Aggie proceeded without inquiry or thanks to unbutton his coat and
      to take from beneath it the small object for which she and Zoie had been
      eagerly waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; sighed Zoie, as she saw Aggie bearing the latest
      acquisition to Alfred's rapidly increasing family safely toward the crib.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly remembering something in his right hand coat pocket, Jimmy called
      to Aggie, who turned to him and waited expectantly. After characteristic
      fumbling, he produced a well filled nursing bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For HER,&rdquo; grunted Jimmy, and he nodded toward the bundle in Aggie's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HER!&rdquo; cried Zoie and Aggie in chorus. Zoie shut her lips hard and gazed
      at him with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known you'd get the wrong kind,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Jimmy thought about the ingratitude of woman was not to be expressed
      in language. He controlled himself as well as he could and merely LOOKED
      the things that he would like to have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it can't be helped now,&rdquo; decided the philosophic Aggie; &ldquo;here,
      Jimmy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you hold 'HER' a minute and I'll get you the other
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Placing the small creature in Jimmy's protesting arms, Aggie turned toward
      the cradle to make the proposed exchange when she was startled by the
      unexpected return of Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the ample folds of Jimmy's ulster, he was able to effectually
      conceal his charge and he started quickly toward the hall, but in making
      the necessary detour around the couch he failed to reach the door before
      Alfred, who had chosen a more direct way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Jimmy,&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred good-naturedly, and he laid a detaining
      hand on his friend's shoulder. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be back,&rdquo; stammered Jimmy weakly, edging his way toward the door,
      and contriving to keep his back toward Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Alfred jovially, as he let his hand slip onto
      Jimmy's arm, &ldquo;you haven't told me the news yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you later,&rdquo; mumbled Jimmy, still trying to escape. But Alfred's
      eye had fallen upon a bit of white flannel dangling below the bottom of
      Jimmy's ulster, it travelled upward to Jimmy's unusually rotund figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; he demanded to know, as he pointed toward the
      centre button of Jimmy's overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; echoed Jimmy vapidly, glancing at the button in question, &ldquo;why,
      that's just a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There was a faint wail from the depths
      of the ulster. Jimmy began to caper about with elephantine tread. &ldquo;Oochie,
      coochie, oochie,&rdquo; he called excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Alfred. The wail became a shriek.
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; cried the anxious father, &ldquo;it's my boy.&rdquo; And with that he
      pounced upon Jimmy, threw wide his ulster and snatched from his arms
      Jimmy's latest contribution to Zoie's scheme of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Aggie had previously remarked, all young babies look very much alike,
      and to the inexperienced eye of this new and overwrought father, there was
      no difference between the infant that he now pressed to his breast, and
      the one that, unsuspected by him, lay peacefully dozing in the crib, not
      ten feet from him. He gazed at the face of the newcomer with the same
      ecstasy that he had felt in the possession of her predecessor. But Zoie
      and Aggie were looking at each other with something quite different from
      ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, with deep emotion, as he clasped the tiny
      creature to his breast. Then he turned to Jimmy. &ldquo;What were you doing with
      my baby?&rdquo; he demanded hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was just taking him out for a little walk!&rdquo; stammered Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just try,&rdquo; threatened Alfred, and he towered over the intimidated
      Jimmy. &ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was of the opinion that he must be crazy or he would never have
      found himself in such a predicament as this, but the anxious faces of Zoie
      and Aggie, denied him the luxury of declaring himself so. He sank mutely
      on the end of the couch and proceeded to sulk in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Aggie and Zoie, they continued to gaze open-mouthed at Alfred, who
      was waltzing about the room transported into a new heaven of delight at
      having snatched his heir from the danger of another night ramble with
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did a horrid old Jimmy spoil his 'itty nap'?&rdquo; he gurgled to Baby. Then
      with a sudden exclamation of alarm, he turned toward the anxious women.
      &ldquo;Aggie!&rdquo; he cried, as he stared intently into Baby's face. &ldquo;Look&mdash;his
      rash! It's turned IN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie pretended to glance over Alfred's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so it has,&rdquo; she agreed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; cried the distraught Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right now,&rdquo; counselled Aggie, &ldquo;so long as it didn't turn in too
      suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better keep him warm, hadn't we?&rdquo; suggested Alfred, remembering
      Aggie's previous instructions on a similar occasion. &ldquo;I'll put him in his
      crib,&rdquo; he decided, and thereupon he made a quick move toward the
      bassinette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staggering back from the cradle with the unsteadiness of a drunken man
      Alfred called upon the Diety. &ldquo;What is THAT?&rdquo; he demanded as he pointed
      toward the unexpected object before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Zoie, Aggie, nor Jimmy could command words to assist Alfred's
      rapidly waning powers of comprehension, and it was not until he had swept
      each face for the third time with a look of inquiry that Zoie found breath
      to stammer nervously, &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;why, that's the OTHER one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other one?&rdquo; echoed Alfred in a dazed manner; then he turned to Aggie
      for further explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; affirmed Aggie, with an emphatic nod, &ldquo;the other one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An undescribable joy was dawning on Alfred's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stared from the infant in his arms to
      the one in the cradle, then back again at Aggie and Zoie. The women
      solemnly nodded their heads. Even Jimmy unblushingly acquiesced. Alfred
      turned toward Zoie for the final confirmation of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; assented Zoie sweetly, &ldquo;that's Alfred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Jimmy and the women saw next appeared to be the dance of a whirling
      dervish; as a matter of fact, it was merely a man, mad with delight,
      clasping two infants in long clothes and circling the room with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alfred could again enunciate distinctly, he rushed to Zoie's side
      with the babes in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;why didn't you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ashamed,&rdquo; whispered Zoie, hiding her head to shut out the sight of
      the red faces pressed close to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My angel!&rdquo; cried Alfred, struggling to control his complicated emotions;
      then gazing at the precious pair in his arms, he cast his eyes devoutly
      toward heaven, &ldquo;Was ever a man so blessed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie peeped from the covers with affected shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love me just as much?&rdquo; she queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you TWICE as much,&rdquo; declared Alfred, and with that he sank
      exhausted on the foot of the bed, vainly trying to teeter one son on each
      knee.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Jimmy gained courage to turn his eyes in the direction of the family
      group he had helped to assemble, he was not reassured by the reproachful
      glances that he met from Aggie and Zoie. It was apparent that in their
      minds, he was again to blame for something. Realising that they dared not
      openly reproach him before Alfred, he decided to make his escape while his
      friend was still in the room. He reached for his hat and tiptoed gingerly
      toward the door, but just as he was congratulating himself upon his
      decision, Alfred called to him with a mysterious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just a minute,&rdquo; and he nodded for Jimmy to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been Jimmy's guilty conscience that made him powerless to
      disobey Alfred's every command. Anyway, he slunk back to the fond parent's
      side, where he ultimately allowed himself to be inveigled into swinging
      his new watch before the unattentive eyes of the red-faced babes on
      Alfred's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower, Jimmy, lower,&rdquo; called Alfred as Jimmy absent-mindedly allowed the
      watch to swing out of the prescribed orbit. &ldquo;Look at the darlings, Jimmy,
      look at them,&rdquo; he exclaimed as he gazed at the small creatures admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, look at them, Jimmy,&rdquo; repeated Zoie, and she glared at Jimmy behind
      Alfred's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you wish you had one of them, Jimmy?'&rdquo; asked Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> wish he had,&rdquo; commented Zoie, and she wondered how she was
      ever again to detach either of them from Alfred's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could form any plan, the telephone rang loud and persistently.
      Jimmy glanced anxiously toward the women for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll answer it,&rdquo; said Aggie with suspicious alacrity, and she crossed
      quickly toward the 'phone. The scattered bits of conversation that Zoie
      was able to gather from Aggie's end of the wire did not tend to soothe her
      over-excited nerves. As for Alfred, he was fortunately so engrossed with
      the babies that he took little notice of what Aggie was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What woman?&rdquo; asked Aggie into the 'phone. &ldquo;Where's she from?&rdquo; The answer
      was evidently not reassuring. &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, &ldquo;don't let
      her come up; send her away. Mrs. Hardy can't see anyone at all.&rdquo; Then
      followed a bit of pantomime between Zoie and Aggie, from which it appeared
      that their troubles were multiplying, then Aggie again gave her attention
      to the 'phone. &ldquo;I don't know anything about her,&rdquo; she fibbed, &ldquo;that woman
      must have the wrong address.&rdquo; And with that she hung up the receiver and
      came towards Alfred, anxious to get possession of his two small charges
      and to get them from the room, lest the mother who was apparently
      downstairs should thrust herself into their midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the trouble, Aggie?&rdquo; asked Alfred, and he nodded toward the
      telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just some woman with the wrong address,&rdquo; answered Aggie with affected
      carelessness. &ldquo;You'd better let me take the babies now, Alfred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them where?&rdquo; asked Alfred with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bed,&rdquo; answered Aggie sweetly, &ldquo;they are going to sleep in the next
      room with Jimmy and me.&rdquo; She laid a detaining hand on Jimmy's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the hurry?&rdquo; asked Alfred a bit disgruntled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very late,&rdquo; argued Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; insisted Zoie. &ldquo;Please, Alfred,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;do let
      Aggie take them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred rose reluctantly. &ldquo;Mother knows best,&rdquo; he sighed, but ignoring
      Aggie's outstretched arms, he refused to relinquish the joy of himself
      carrying the small mites to their room, and he disappeared with the two of
      them, singing his now favourite lullaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alfred had left the room, Jimmy, who was now seated comfortably in
      the rocker, was rudely startled by a sharp voice at either side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; shrieked Zoie, with all the disapproval that could be got into the
      one small word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very clever, aren't you?&rdquo; sneered Aggie at Jimmy's other elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy stared from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice fix you've got me into NOW,&rdquo; reproved Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you get out when you had the chance?&rdquo; demanded Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would take your own sweet time, wouldn't you,&rdquo; said Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; asked Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he care?&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, and she walked up and down the room
      excitedly, oblivious of the disarrangement of her flying negligee. &ldquo;He's
      perfectly comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; assented Jimmy, as he sank back into the rocker and began
      propelling himself to and fro. &ldquo;I never felt better,&rdquo; but a disinterested
      observer would have seen in him the picture of discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going to feel a great deal WORSE,&rdquo; he was warned by Aggie. &ldquo;Do you
      know who that was on the telephone?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked at her mutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother!&rdquo; said Aggie emphatically
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's down stairs,&rdquo; explained Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy had stopped rocking&mdash;his face now wore an uneasy expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's time you showed a little human intelligence,&rdquo; taunted Zoie, then she
      turned her back upon him and continued to Aggie, &ldquo;what did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says,&rdquo; answered Aggie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy, &ldquo;that
      she won't leave this place until Jimmy gives her baby back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her have her old baby,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;I don't want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want it?&rdquo; snapped Zoie indignantly, &ldquo;what have YOU got to do
      with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothing, nothing,&rdquo; acquiesced Jimmy meekly, &ldquo;I'm a mere detail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot you care what becomes of me,&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie reproachfully; then
      she turned to Aggie with a decided nod. &ldquo;Well, I want it,&rdquo; she asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Zoie,&rdquo; protested Aggie in astonishment, &ldquo;you can't mean to keep BOTH
      of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly DO,&rdquo; said Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Aggie and Jimmy in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy has presented Alfred with twins,&rdquo; continued Zoie testily, &ldquo;and now,
      he has to HAVE twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy's eyes were growing rounder and rounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; continued Zoie, with a growing sense of indignation, &ldquo;what
      would happen to me if I told Alfred NOW that he WASN'T the father of
      twins? He'd fly straight out of that door and I'd never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie admitted that Zoie was no doubt speaking the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy has awakened Alfred's paternal instinct for twins,&rdquo; declared Zoie,
      with another emphatic nod of her head, &ldquo;and now Jimmy must take the
      consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy tried to frame a few faint objections, but Zoie waved him aside,
      with a positive air. &ldquo;It's no use arguing. If it were only ONE, it
      wouldn't be so bad, but to tell Alfred that he's lost twins, he couldn't
      live through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Zoie,&rdquo; argued Aggie, &ldquo;we can't have that mother hanging around down
      stairs until that baby is an old man. She'll have us arrested, the next
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why arrest US?&rdquo; asked Zoie, with wide baby eyes. &ldquo;WE didn't take it. Old
      slow-poke took it.&rdquo; And she nodded toward the now utterly vanquished
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; murmured Jimmy, with a weak attempt at sarcasm, &ldquo;don't
      leave me out of anything good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter WHICH one she arrests,&rdquo; decided the practical Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it matters to me,&rdquo; objected Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to me too, if it's all the same to you,&rdquo; protested Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever it is,&rdquo; continued Aggie, &ldquo;the truth is bound to come out. Alfred
      will have to know sooner or later, so we might as well make a clean breast
      of it, first as last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the first sensible thing you've said in three months,&rdquo; declared
      Jimmy with reviving hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; sneered Zoie, and she levelled her most malicious look
      at Jimmy. &ldquo;What do you think Alfred would do to YOU, Mr. Jimmy, if he knew
      the truth? YOU'RE the one who sent him the telegram; you are the one who
      told him that he was a FATHER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; admitted Aggie, with a wrinkled forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie was quick to see her advantage. She followed it up. &ldquo;And Alfred
      hasn't any sense of humour, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could he have?&rdquo; groaned Jimmy; &ldquo;he's married.&rdquo; And with that he sank
      into his habitual state of dumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sarcasm will do a great deal of good,&rdquo; flashed Zoie. Then she
      dismissed him with a nod, and crossed to her dressing table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Zoie,&rdquo; persisted Aggie, as she followed her young friend in
      trepidation, &ldquo;don't you realise that if you persist in keeping this baby,
      that mother will dog Jimmy's footsteps for the rest of his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be nice,&rdquo; murmured Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie busied herself with her toilet, and turned a deaf ear to Aggie. There
      was a touch of genuine emotion in Aggie's voice when she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of it, Zoie, Jimmy will never be able to come and go like a
      free man again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care how he comes and goes?&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie impatiently. &ldquo;If
      Jimmy had gone when we told him to go, that woman would have had her old
      baby by now; but he didn't, oh no! All he ever does is to sit around and
      talk about his dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Jimmy hotly, &ldquo;and that's about as far as I ever GET with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll never get anywhere with anything,&rdquo; was Zoie's exasperating answer.
      &ldquo;You're too slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's nothing slow about you,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy, stung to a frenzy
      by her insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh please, please,&rdquo; interposed Aggie, desperately determined to keep
      these two irascible persons to the main issue. &ldquo;What are we going to tell
      that mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell her whatever you like,&rdquo; answered Zoie, with an impudent toss
      of her head, &ldquo;but I'll NOT give up that baby until I get ANOTHER one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another?&rdquo; almost shrieked Jimmy. It was apparent that he must needs
      increase the number of his brain cells if he were to follow this
      extraordinary young woman's line of thought much further. &ldquo;You don't
      expect to go on multiplying them forever, do you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU are the one who has been multiplying them,&rdquo; was Zoie's disconcerting
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident to Jimmy that he could not think fast enough nor clearly
      enough to save himself from a mental disaster if he continued to argue
      with the shameless young woman, so he contented himself by rocking to and
      fro and murmuring dismally that he had &ldquo;known from the first that it was
      to be an endless chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Zoie and Jimmy had been wrangling, Aggie had been weighing the pros
      and cons of the case. She now turned to Jimmy with a tone of firm but
      motherly decision. &ldquo;Zoie is quite right,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy rolled his large eyes up at his spouse with a &ldquo;you too, Brutus,&rdquo;
       expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie continued mercilessly, &ldquo;It's the only way, Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Aggie arrived at her decision than Zoie upset her
      tranquillity by a triumphant expression of &ldquo;I have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Zoie's radiant face in consternation. They were
      accustomed to see only reproach there. Her sudden enthusiasm increased
      Jimmy's uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU have it,&rdquo; he grunted without attempting to conceal his disgust.
      &ldquo;SHE'S the one who generally has it.&rdquo; And he nodded toward Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inflamed by her young friend's enthusiasm, Aggie rushed to her eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Zoie?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The washerwoman!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, as though the revelation had come
      straight from heaven. &ldquo;SHE HAD TWINS,&rdquo; and with that, two pairs of eyes
      turned expectantly toward the only man in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracing the pattern of the rug with his toe, Jimmy remained stubbornly
      oblivious of their attentions. He rearranged the pillows on the couch, and
      finally, for want of a better occupation, he wound his watch. All to no
      avail. He could feel Zoie's cat-like gaze upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy can get the other one,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell I can,&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, starting to his feet and no longer
      considering time or place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women gazed at him reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; cried Aggie, in a shocked, hurt voice. &ldquo;That's the first time
      I've ever heard you swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it won't be the LAST time,&rdquo; declared Jimmy hotly, &ldquo;if THIS keeps
      up.&rdquo; His eyes were blazing. He paced to and fro like an infuriated lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said Aggie, &ldquo;you look almost imposing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; interrupted Zoie, who found Jimmy unusually ridiculous. &ldquo;If
      I'd known that Jimmy was going to put such an idea into Alfred's head, I'd
      have got the two in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she let us HAVE the other?&rdquo; asked Aggie with some misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she will,&rdquo; answered Zoie, leaving Jimmy entirely out of the
      conversation. &ldquo;She's as poor as a church mouse. I'll pay her well. She'll
      never miss it. What could she do with one twin, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A snort of rage from Jimmy did not disturb Zoie's enthusiasm. She
      proceeded to elaborate her plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll adopt them,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I'll leave them all Alfred's money.
      Think of Alfred having real live twins for keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be nice, wouldn't it?&rdquo; commented Jimmy sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie turned to Jimmy, as though they were on the best of terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much money have you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Jimmy could declare himself penniless, Aggie answered for him with
      the greatest enthusiasm, &ldquo;He has a whole lot; he drew some today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie to the abashed Jimmy, and then she continued in a
      matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;Now, Jimmy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you go give the washwoman
      what money you have on account, then tell her to come around here in the
      morning when Alfred has gone out and I'll settle all the details with her.
      Go on now, Jimmy,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;you don't need another letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; chimed in Aggie sweetly; &ldquo;you know her now, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; corroborated Jimmy, with a sarcastic smile and without budging
      from the spot on which he stood, &ldquo;we are great pals now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Zoie, astonished that Jimmy was not starting on
      his mission with alacrity. &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy merely continued to smile enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what happened the last time you hesitated,&rdquo; warned Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what happened when I DIDN'T hesitate,&rdquo; ruminated Jimmy, still
      holding his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie's eyes were wide with surprise. &ldquo;You don't mean to say,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed incredulously, &ldquo;that you aren't GOING&mdash;after we have
      thought all this out just to SAVE you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, with a confidential air, &ldquo;do me a favour, will you?
      Stop thinking out things to 'save me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Jimmy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested both women simultaneously; but before
      they could get further Alfred's distressed voice reached them from the
      next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie!&rdquo; he called frantically.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      What seemed to be a streak of pink through the room was in reality Zoie
      bolting for the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Zoie hastened to snuggle comfortably under the covers, Aggie tried
      without avail to get Jimmy started on his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting no response from Aggie, Alfred, bearing one infant in his arms,
      came in search of her. Apparently he was having difficulty with the
      unfastening of baby's collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie,&rdquo; he called sharply, &ldquo;how on earth do you get this fool pin out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him back, Alfred,&rdquo; answered Aggie impatiently; &ldquo;I'll be there in a
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred had apparently made up his mind that he was not a success as a
      nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better take him now, Aggie,&rdquo; he decided, as he offered the small
      person to the reluctant Aggie. &ldquo;I'll stay here and talk to Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Jimmy was just going out,&rdquo; answered Aggie; then she turned to her
      obdurate spouse with mock sweetness, &ldquo;Weren't you, dear?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; affirmed Zoie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy. &ldquo;He was
      going, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Jimmy remained rooted to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out?&rdquo; questioned Alfred. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for a little air,&rdquo; explained Aggie blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Jimmy, &ldquo;another little heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air?&rdquo; repeated Alfred in surprise. &ldquo;He had air a while ago with my son.
      He is going to stay here and tell me the news. Sit down, Jimmy,&rdquo; he
      commanded, and to the intense annoyance of Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy sank
      resignedly on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was about to seat himself beside his friend, when the 'phone rang
      violently. Being nearest to the instrument, Alfred reached it first and
      Zoie and Aggie awaited the consequences in dread. What they heard did not
      reassure them nor Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still down there?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred into the 'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy began to wriggle with a vague uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Alfred at the 'phone, &ldquo;that woman has the wrong number.&rdquo;
       Then with a peremptory &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he turned to Zoie, &ldquo;The hall boy
      says that woman who called a while ago is still down stairs and she won't
      go away until she has seen you, Zoie. She has some kind of an idiotic idea
      that you know where her baby is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd,&rdquo; sneered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly,&rdquo; added Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish,&rdquo; grunted Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; decided Alfred, &ldquo;I'd better go down stairs and see what's the
      matter with her,&rdquo; and he turned toward the door to carry out his
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred!&rdquo; called Zoie sharply. She was half out of bed in her anxiety.
      &ldquo;You'll do no such thing. 'Phone down to the boy to send her away. She's
      crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;then she's been here before? Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; answered Zoie, trying to gain time for a new inspiration.
      &ldquo;Why, she's&mdash;she's&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; her face lit up with satisfaction&mdash;the
      idea had arrived. &ldquo;She's the nurse,&rdquo; she concluded emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nurse?&rdquo; repeated Alfred, a bit confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Zoie, pretending to be annoyed with his dull memory.
      &ldquo;She's the one I told you about, the one I had to discharge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alfred, with the relief of sudden comprehension; &ldquo;the crazy
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie and Zoie nodded their heads and smiled at him tolerantly, then Zoie
      continued to elaborate. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the poor creature was so
      insane about little Jimmy that I couldn't go near the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred in a mighty rage. &ldquo;I'll soon tell the boy what to
      do with her,&rdquo; he declared, and he rushed to the 'phone. Barely had Alfred
      taken the receiver from the hook when the outer door was heard to bang.
      Before he could speak a distracted young woman, whose excitable manner
      bespoke her foreign origin, swept through the door without seeing him and
      hurled herself at the unsuspecting Zoie. The woman's black hair was
      dishevelled, and her large shawl had fallen from her shoulders. To Jimmy,
      who was crouching behind an armchair, she seemed a giantess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My baby!&rdquo; cried the frenzied mother, with what was unmistakably an
      Italian accent. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; There was no answer; her eyes sought the
      cradle. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she shrieked, then upon finding the cradle empty, she
      redoubled her lamentations and again she bore down upon the terrified
      Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you know where my baby is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Zoie sank back amongst her pillows and drew the bed covers
      completely over her head. Alfred approached the bed to protect his young
      wife; the Italian woman wheeled about and perceived a small child in his
      arms. She threw herself upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Managing to disengage himself from what he considered a mad woman, and
      elevating one elbow between her and the child, Alfred prevented the mother
      from snatching the small creature from his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, madam,&rdquo; he commanded with a superior air. &ldquo;We are very
      sorry for you, of course, but we can't have you coming here and going on
      like this. He's OUR baby and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's NOT your baby!&rdquo; cried the infuriated mother; &ldquo;he's MY baby. Give him
      to me. Give him to me,&rdquo; and with that she sprang upon the uncomfortable
      Alfred like a tigress. Throwing her whole weight on his uplifted elbow,
      she managed to pull down his arm until she could look into the face of the
      washerwoman's promising young offspring. The air was rent by a scream that
      made each individual hair of Jimmy's head stand up in its own defence. He
      could feel a sickly sensation at the top of his short thick neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's NOT my baby,&rdquo; wailed the now demented mother, little dreaming that
      the infant for which she was searching was now reposing comfortably on a
      soft pillow in the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Alfred, all of this was merely confirmation of Zoie's statement
      that this poor soul was crazy, and he was tempted to dismiss her with
      worthy forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are coming to your senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, all would have gone well and the bewildered mother would no doubt
      have left the room convinced of her mistake, had not Jimmy's nerves got
      the better of his judgment. Having slipped cautiously from his position
      behind the armchair he was tiptoeing toward the door, and was flattering
      himself on his escape, when suddenly, as his forward foot cautiously
      touched the threshold, he heard the cry of the captor in his wake, and
      before he could possibly command the action of his other foot, he felt
      himself being forcibly drawn backward by what appeared to be his too
      tenacious coat-tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only they would tear,&rdquo; thought Jimmy, but thanks to the excellence of
      the tailor that Aggie had selected for him, they did NOT &ldquo;tear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not until she had anchored Jimmy safely to the centre of the rug did the
      irate mother pour out the full venom of her resentment toward him. From
      the mixture of English and Italian that followed, it was apparent that she
      was accusing Jimmy of having stolen her baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to him,&rdquo; she demanded tragically; &ldquo;my baby&mdash;take me to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy appealed to Aggie and Zoie. Their faces were as blank as his own. He
      glanced at Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humour her,&rdquo; whispered Alfred, much elated by the evidence of his own
      self-control as compared to Jimmy's utter demoralisation under the
      apparently same circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Jimmy did not budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was becoming vexed; he pointed first to his own forehead, then to
      that of Jimmy's hysterical captor. He even illustrated his meaning by
      making a rotary motion with his forefinger, intended to remind Jimmy that
      the woman was a lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming
      more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Alfred, out of all patience with Jimmy's stupidity and
      tiring of the strain of the woman's presence. &ldquo;You know where her baby
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the mother, and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in
      her eyes. &ldquo;Take me to him,&rdquo; she demanded; &ldquo;take me to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie, then toward Zoie and at
      last toward Alfred. There was no mercy to be found anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her to him, Jimmy,&rdquo; commanded a concert of voices; and pursued by a
      bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds, Jimmy shot
      from the room.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a
      general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room. Exhausted by
      what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future. It was
      enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and draw
      a long breath without an evil face bending over her, and without the air
      being rent by screams.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Aggie, she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes. The
      horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented themselves
      to her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three, Alfred was the only one who had apparently received
      exhilaration from the encounter. He was strutting about the room with the
      babe in his arms, undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero. When he
      could sufficiently control his feeling of elation, he looked down at the
      small person with an air of condescension and again lent himself to the
      garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants are inevitably
      persecuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie,
      woppsie, toppsie babykins,&rdquo; he said. Then he turned to Zoie with an air of
      great decision. &ldquo;That woman ought to be locked up,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;she's
      dangerous,&rdquo; and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly placed the
      infant in her unsuspecting arms. &ldquo;Here, Aggie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you take Alfred
      and get him into bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self control,
      Aggie quickly disappeared with the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room; then he
      came to a full stop before Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to have something done to that woman,&rdquo; he declared
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy will do enough to her,&rdquo; sighed Zoie, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's no business to be at large,&rdquo; continued Alfred; then, with a
      business-like air, he started toward the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred did not answer. He was now calling into the 'phone, &ldquo;Give me
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you doing?&rdquo; demanded Zoie, more and more disturbed by
      his mysterious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can't be too careful,&rdquo; retorted Alfred in his most paternal fashion;
      &ldquo;there's an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don't suspect information, do you?&rdquo; asked Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Alfred ignored her; he was intent upon things of more importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he called into the 'phone, &ldquo;is this information?&rdquo; Apparently it
      was for he continued, with a satisfied air, &ldquo;Well, give me the Fullerton
      Street Police Station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Police?&rdquo; cried Zoie, sitting up in bed and looking about the room
      with a new sense of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggie!&rdquo; shrieked the over-wrought young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred attempted to reassure her. &ldquo;Now, now, dear, don't get nervous,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I am only taking the necessary precautions.&rdquo; And again he turned to
      the 'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed by Zoie's summons, Aggie entered the room hastily. She was not
      reassured upon hearing Alfred's further conversation at the 'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station?&rdquo; asked Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Police!&rdquo; echoed Aggie, and her eyes sought Zoie's inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Sh!&rdquo; called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie, then he
      continued into the 'phone. &ldquo;Is Donneghey there?&rdquo; There was a pause. Alfred
      laughed jovially. &ldquo;It is? Well, hello, Donneghey, this is your old friend
      Hardy, Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood. I've just got back,&rdquo; then he broke
      the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey. &ldquo;What do you
      think?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm a happy father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie puckered her small face in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the 'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes&mdash;sure&mdash;on the level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood,&rdquo; snapped Zoie.
      Her colour was visibly rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend.
      &ldquo;Set 'em up?&rdquo; he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the
      other end of the line, &ldquo;I should say I would. The drinks are on me. Tell
      the boys I'll be right over. And say, Donneghey,&rdquo; he added, in a more
      confidential tone, &ldquo;I want to bring one of the men home with me. I want
      him to keep an eye on the house to-night&rdquo;; then after a pause, he
      concluded confidentially, &ldquo;I'll tell you all about it when I get there. It
      looks like a kidnapping scheme to me,&rdquo; and with that he hung up the
      receiver, unmistakably pleased with himself, and turned his beaming face
      toward Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, dear,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands together with evident
      satisfaction, &ldquo;Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to
      watch the house to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't HAVE a special officer,&rdquo; declared Zoie vehemently; then becoming
      aware of Alfred's great surprise, she explained half-tearfully, &ldquo;I'm not
      going to have the police hanging around our very door. I would feel as
      though I were in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE in prison, my dear,&rdquo; returned the now irrepressible Alfred. &ldquo;A
      prison of love&mdash;you and our precious boys.&rdquo; He stooped and implanted
      a gracious kiss on her forehead, then turned toward the table for his hat.
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll just run around the corner, set up the drinks for
      the boys, and bring the officer home with me,&rdquo; and drawing himself up
      proudly, he cried gaily in parting, &ldquo;I'll bet there's not another man in
      Chicago who has what I have to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; groaned Zoie. as the door closed behind him. Then, thrusting
      her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on the side of
      the bed, she declared to Aggie that &ldquo;Alfred was getting more idiotic every
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's worse than idiotic,&rdquo; corrected Aggie. &ldquo;He's getting dangerous. If he
      gets the police around here before we give that baby back, they'll get the
      mother. She'll tell all she knows and that will be the end of Jimmy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;End of Jimmy?&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, &ldquo;it'll be the end of ALL of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see our pictures in the papers, right now,&rdquo; groaned Aggie. &ldquo;Jimmy
      will be the villain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy IS a villain,&rdquo; declared Zoie. &ldquo;Where is he? Why doesn't he come
      back? How am I ever going to get that other twin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one thing to do,&rdquo; decided Aggie, &ldquo;I must go for it myself.&rdquo;
       And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried Zoie, in alarm, &ldquo;and leave me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's our only chance,&rdquo; argued Aggie. &ldquo;I'll have to do it now, before
      Alfred gets back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Aggie,&rdquo; protested Zoie, clinging to her departing friend, &ldquo;suppose
      that crazy mother should come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Aggie, and before Zoie could actually realise what was
      happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wondering what new terrors awaited her, Zoie glanced uncertainly from door
      to door. So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the bed, that
      unconsciously she backed toward it now. Barely had she reached the centre
      of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the adjoining
      room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard, and head first under
      the covers. Here she would doubtless have remained until suffocated, had
      not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the inner rooms overturned a
      large rocker. This additional shock to Zoie's overstrung nerves forced a
      wild scream from her lips, and an answering exclamation from the
      nerve-racked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright. She gazed at him in
      astonishment. His tie was awry, one end of his collar had taken leave of
      its anchorage beneath his stout chin, and was now just tickling the edge
      of his red, perspiring brow. His hair was on end and his feelings were
      undeniably ruffled. As usual Zoie's greeting did not tend to conciliate
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did YOU get here?&rdquo; she asked with an air of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire-escape,&rdquo; panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the
      inner rooms of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire-escape?&rdquo; echoed Zoie. There was only one and that led through the
      bathroom window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy explained no further. He was now peeping cautiously out of the
      window toward the pavement below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the mother?&rdquo; demanded Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street. Zoie gazed at him
      with grave apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You haven't killed her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do with her?&rdquo; called the now exasperated Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did <i>I</i> do with her?&rdquo; repeated Jimmy, a flash of his old
      resentment returning. &ldquo;What did SHE do with ME?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmy's ludicrous
      appearance. Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh
      hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; shouted Jimmy, towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that she
      were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity. &ldquo;Don't you sic
      any more lunatics onto me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether Zoie's continued laughter might not have provoked
      Jimmy to desperate measures, had not the 'phone at that moment directed
      their thoughts toward worse possibilities. After the instrument had
      continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age, she
      motioned to Jimmy to answer it. He responded by retreating to the other
      side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be Aggie,&rdquo; suggested Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he realised that he was again tete-a-tete
      with the terror of his dreams. &ldquo;Where IS Aggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to do what YOU should have done,&rdquo; was Zoie's characteristic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Jimmy hotly, &ldquo;it's about time that somebody besides me
      did something around this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU,&rdquo; mocked Zoie, &ldquo;all YOU'VE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very
      beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd taken my advice,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, &ldquo;and told your husband the
      truth about the luncheon, there'd never have been any 'beginning.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, if, if,&rdquo; cried Zoie, in an agony of impatience, &ldquo;if you'd tipped that
      horrid old waiter enough, he'd never have told anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not buying waiters to cover up your crimes,&rdquo; announced Jimmy with his
      most self-righteous air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before you've
      finished,&rdquo; retorted Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I've finished with YOU, yes,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy. He wheeled upon her
      with increasing resentment. &ldquo;Do you know where I expect to end up?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where you OUGHT to end up,&rdquo; snapped Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll finish in the electric chair,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;I can feel blue
      lightning chasing up and down my spine right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair,&rdquo; declared Zoie,
      &ldquo;before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do, do you?&rdquo; answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the
      foot of the bed. For the want of adequate words to express his further
      feelings, Jimmy was beginning to jibber, when the outer door was heard to
      close, and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with something
      partly concealed by her long cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie. &ldquo;I've got it.&rdquo; She
      threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; snorted Jimmy in disgust, slightly miffed by the apparent ease with
      which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much ado,
      &ldquo;you've gone into the business too, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aggie deigned no reply to him. She continued in a businesslike tone to
      Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Alfred?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still out,&rdquo; answered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; sighed Aggie, then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him
      in rapid, decided tones. &ldquo;Now, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'll just put the new
      baby to bed, then I'll give you the other one and you can take it right
      down to the mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fire-escape. Four
      detaining hands were laid upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try anything like that,&rdquo; warned Aggie; &ldquo;you can't get out of this
      house without that baby. The mother is down stairs now. She's guarding the
      door. I saw her.&rdquo; And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to make
      the proposed exchange of babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggie's last
      plan of action, the telephone again began to cry for attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient
      instrument, and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in her
      arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, Jimmy,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;here's the other one. Now take him down
      stairs quickly before Alfred gets back.&rdquo; She attempted to place the
      unresisting babe in Jimmy's chubby arms, but Jimmy's freedom was not to be
      so easily disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, backing away from the small creature in fear and
      abhorrence, &ldquo;take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have
      that woman hystericing all over me. No, thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; answered Aggie, distracted by the persistent ringing of the
      'phone, &ldquo;then hold him a minute until I answer the 'phone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This at least was a compromise, and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now
      wailing infant to be placed in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jig it, Jimmy, jig it,&rdquo; cried Zoie. Jimmy looked down helplessly at the
      baby's angry red face, but before he had made much headway with the
      &ldquo;jigging,&rdquo; Aggie returned to them, much excited by the message which she
      had just received over the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; chided Zoie, in a fury at Jimmy, &ldquo;what did Aggie tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she wants this thing,&rdquo; maintained Jimmy, looking down at the bundle in
      his arms, &ldquo;she can come after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't have her up here,&rdquo; objected Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred may be back at any minute. He'd catch her. You know what happened
      the last time we tried to change them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can send it down the chimney, for all I care,&rdquo; concluded Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, her face suddenly illumined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord,&rdquo; groaned Jimmy, who had come to regard any elation on Zoie's or
      Aggie's part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Aggie had recourse to the 'phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she called to the office boy, &ldquo;tell that woman to go around to
      the back door, and we'll send something down to her.&rdquo; There was a slight
      pause, then Aggie added sweetly, &ldquo;Yes, tell her to wait at the foot of the
      fire-escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggie's intention and she now fixed
      her glittering eyes upon Jimmy, who was already shifting about uneasily
      and glancing at Aggie, who approached him with a business-like air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, dear,&rdquo; said Aggie, &ldquo;come with me. I'll hand Baby out through the
      bathroom window and you can run right down the fire-escape with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do run down the fire-escape,&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, wagging his large
      head from side to side, &ldquo;I'll keep right on RUNNING. That's the last
      you'll ever see of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Jimmy,&rdquo; protested Aggie, slightly hurt by his threat, &ldquo;once that
      woman gets her baby you'll have no more trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you two still alive?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, looking from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be up here if you don't hurry,&rdquo; urged Aggie impatiently, and with
      that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her come,&rdquo; said Jimmy, planting his feet so as to resist Aggie's
      repeated tugs, &ldquo;I'm going to South America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will you act like this,&rdquo; cried Aggie, in utter desperation, &ldquo;when we
      have so little time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Jimmy irrelevantly, &ldquo;do you know that I haven't had any&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus, &ldquo;we know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long,&rdquo; continued Zoie impatiently, &ldquo;is it going to take you to slip
      down that fire-escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on how fast I 'slip,'&rdquo; answered Jimmy doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll 'slip' all right,&rdquo; sneered Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut
      short by the banging of the outside door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, glancing nervously over her shoulder,
      &ldquo;there's Alfred now. Hurry, Jimmy, hurry,&rdquo; she cried, and with that she
      fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door, and followed in his wake
      to see him safely down the fire-escape.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an interesting
      invalid, when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, dearie,&rdquo; he cried as he crossed quickly to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door,
      through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I shouldn't be long,&rdquo; said Alfred jovially, and he implanted a
      condescending kiss on her forehead. &ldquo;How is the little mother, eh?&rdquo; he
      asked, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all cold,&rdquo; pouted Zoie, edging away, &ldquo;and you've been drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to have one or two with the boys,&rdquo; said Alfred, throwing out his
      chest and strutting about the room, &ldquo;but never again. From now on I cut
      out all drinks and cigars. This is where I begin to live my life for our
      sons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about your life for me?&rdquo; asked Zoie, as she began to see long years
      of boredom stretching before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and our boys are one and the same, dear,&rdquo; answered Alfred, coming
      back to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you couldn't go on loving ME if it weren't for the BOYS?&rdquo; asked
      Zoie, with anxiety. She was beginning to realise how completely her hold
      upon him depended upon her hideous deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I could, Zoie,&rdquo; answered Alfred, flattered by what he
      considered her desire for his complete devotion, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not so MUCH,&rdquo; pouted Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, dear,&rdquo; admitted Alfred evasively, as he sank down upon
      the edge of the bed by her side&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't say another word,&rdquo; interrupted Zoie, and then with a shade of
      genuine repentance, she declared shame-facedly that she hadn't been &ldquo;much
      of a wife&rdquo; to Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; contradicted the proud young father, &ldquo;you've given me the ONE
      thing that I wanted most in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see, dear,&rdquo; said Zoie, as she wound her little white arms about
      his neck, and looked up into his face adoringly, &ldquo;YOU'VE been the 'ONE'
      thing that I wanted 'MOST' and I never realised until to-night how&mdash;how
      crazy you are about things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; asked Alfred, a bit puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Zoie, letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit
      of imaginary lint on the coverlet, &ldquo;babies and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alfred, and he was about to proceed when she again interrupted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now that I DO realise it,&rdquo; continued Zoie, earnestly, her fingers on
      his lips, lest he again interrupt, &ldquo;if you'll only have a little patience
      with me, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; again her eyes fell bashfully to
      the coverlet, as she considered the possibility of being ultimately
      obliged to replace the bogus twins with real ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the patience in the world,&rdquo; answered Alfred, little dreaming of the
      problem that confronted the contrite Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all I ask,&rdquo; declared Zoie, her assurance completely restored, &ldquo;and
      in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she glanced
      anxiously toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nothing is going to happen to these, dear,&rdquo; interrupted Alfred,
      rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection. &ldquo;I'll attend to
      that. There, there,&rdquo; he added, patting her small shoulder and nodding his
      head wisely. &ldquo;That crazy woman has got on your nerves, but you needn't
      worry, I've got everything fixed. Donneghey sent a special officer over
      with me. He's outside watching the house, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; shrieked Zoie, fixing her eyes on the bedroom door, through which
      Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet &ldquo;slipped&rdquo;
       down the fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Alfred, walking up and down the floor with a masterly
      stride. &ldquo;If that woman is caught hanging around here again, she'll get a
      little surprise. My boys are safe now, God bless them!&rdquo; Then reminded of
      the fact that he had not seen them since his return, he started quickly
      toward the bedroom door. &ldquo;I'll just have a look at the little rascals,&rdquo; he
      decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; cried Zoie. She caught Alfred's arm as he passed the side of
      her bed, and clung to him in desperation. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred looked down at her in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face toward the door, and called lustily, &ldquo;Aggie! Aggie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; questioned Alfred, thinking Zoie suddenly ill, &ldquo;can I
      get you something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Zoie was obliged to reply, Aggie answered her summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you call?&rdquo; she asked, glancing inquiringly into Zoie's distressed
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alfred's here,&rdquo; said Zoie, with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand
      and glanced meaningly at Aggie. &ldquo;He's GOT the OFFICER!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The OFFICER?&rdquo; cried Aggie, and involuntarily she took a step backward, as
      though to guard the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alfred, mistaking Aggie's surprise for a compliment to his
      resource; &ldquo;and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute I'll
      have a look at my boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in
      front of the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're asleep,&rdquo; explained Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not WAKE them,&rdquo; persisted Alfred, &ldquo;I just wish to have a LOOK at
      them,&rdquo; and with that he again made a move toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Alfred,&rdquo; protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, &ldquo;you're not
      going to leave me again&mdash;so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of
      their persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way of
      over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay with Zoie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll bring the boys in here and you can
      both have a look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Aggie,&rdquo; argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, &ldquo;would it
      be wise to wake them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this once,&rdquo; said Aggie. &ldquo;Now you stay here and I'll get them.&rdquo;
       Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door
      had closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished
      his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room with
      a new air of proprietorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is certainly a great night, Zoie,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made Alfred
      turn to her with new concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly did,&rdquo; said Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that
      moment, there came a sharp ring at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had
      advanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE jumpy,&rdquo; said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud
      voices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall. &ldquo;What's
      that?&rdquo; asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's
      frantic embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert ear
      caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute in
      the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds like the officer,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The officer?&rdquo; cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about him.

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Propelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted
      collar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go of me,&rdquo; shouted the hapless Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a large
      burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the reluctant
      Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got him for you, sir,&rdquo; announced the officer proudly, to the astonished
      Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to struggle to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to
      the bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; He snatched the infant from the officer and
      pressed him jealously to his breast. &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; he said, gazing
      at the officer in stupefaction. &ldquo;Where was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean this one?&rdquo; asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate
      Jimmy. &ldquo;I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I KNEW it,&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at
      Jimmy for his awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew WHAT, dear?&rdquo; asked Alfred, now thoroughly puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie did not answer. Her powers of resource were fast waning. Alfred
      turned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing
      defiance into the officer's threatening eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;this is awful. What's the matter with you, Jimmy?
      This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out into the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you've had trouble with him before?&rdquo; remarked the officer. He
      studied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought a
      confirmed &ldquo;baby-snatcher&rdquo; to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a little trouble myself,&rdquo; declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved to
      make a clean breast of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not asking about your troubles,&rdquo; interrupted the officer savagely,
      and Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on
      his collar. &ldquo;Go ahead, sir,&rdquo; said the officer to Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, &ldquo;he was out with
      my boy when I arrived. I stopped him from going out with him a second
      time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the fire-escape. I
      don't know what to say,&rdquo; he finished weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do,&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high
      explosive, &ldquo;and I'll say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it,&rdquo; shouted the officer. And before Jimmy could get further, Alfred
      resumed with fresh vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's supposed to be a friend of mine,&rdquo; he explained to the officer, as he
      nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy. &ldquo;He was all right when I left him a few
      months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll think I'm all right again,&rdquo; shouted Jimmy, trying to get free from
      the officer, &ldquo;before I've finished telling all I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't help any,&rdquo; interrupted the officer firmly, and with another
      twist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most
      civil manner, &ldquo;What shall I do with him, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject
      for a straight jacket. &ldquo;This is horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's absurd,&rdquo; cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter despair
      of ever disentangling the present complication without ultimately losing
      Alfred, &ldquo;you're all absurd,&rdquo; she cried wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, &ldquo;what do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a joke,&rdquo; said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke
      lay. &ldquo;If you had any sense you could see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DON'T see it,&rdquo; said Alfred, with hurt dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; said Jimmy, with boiling resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you call it a joke,&rdquo; asked Alfred, incredulously, &ldquo;to have our boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion piece to this
      youngster. &ldquo;The other one!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;our other boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified face to Zoie.
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Alfred,&rdquo; pleaded Zoie, &ldquo;don't get excited; he's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked the distracted father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as
      usual he was the source of an inspiration for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy never cared for the other one,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said,
      then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other boy
      was quite safe. The picture that confronted him brought the hair straight
      up on his head. True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's return with
      the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to appear on the
      threshold with one babe on each arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight
      of the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied
      hand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition, &ldquo;THOSE
      aren't MINE,&rdquo; he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh&mdash;why not, Alfred?&rdquo; stammered Aggie for the want of something
      better to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; shrieked Alfred. Then he turned in appeal to his young wife, whose
      face had now become utterly expressionless. &ldquo;Zoie?&rdquo; he entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and
      she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OURS, dear,&rdquo; she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But THIS one?&rdquo; persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and
      feeling sure that his mind was about to give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;why,&rdquo; stuttered Zoie, &ldquo;THAT'S the JOKE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joke?&rdquo; echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but
      such.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their
      temporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future. &ldquo;Didn't Jimmy
      tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me WHAT?&rdquo; stammered Alfred, &ldquo;what IS there to tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each
      elaboration of Zoie's lie, &ldquo;we didn't dare to break it to you too
      suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break it to me?&rdquo; gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, &ldquo;we
      asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction. Was it possible that
      she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'ASKED Jimmy'?&rdquo; repeated Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, &ldquo;we wanted you to get used
      to the idea gradually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; echoed Alfred. He was afraid to allow his mind to accept too
      suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy
      over-power him. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;do&mdash;don't mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
      stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a
      languid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boys! My boys!&rdquo; cried Alfred, now delirious with delight. &ldquo;Give them
      to me,&rdquo; he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants savagely
      from her arms. &ldquo;Give me ALL of them, ALL of them.&rdquo; He clasped the three
      babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the unsuspecting Zoie
      and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to
      hers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her
      unmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his
      heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind in
      general. Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated that
      bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss. A proceeding which Jimmy did
      not at all approve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled Jimmy
      was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a loud
      resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young friend.
      Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred veered off in
      the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in time to avoid
      similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred
      suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air, and
      feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his
      short-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, &ldquo;if this is all a
      joke, I'll let the woman go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman,&rdquo; repeated Alfred; &ldquo;what woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape,&rdquo; explained the officer.
      Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly. &ldquo;I thought she might be
      an accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she look like, officer?&rdquo; asked Alfred. His manner was becoming
      more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of each new
      infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly, Alfred,&rdquo; snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was
      making such an idiot of himself. &ldquo;It's only the nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's it,&rdquo; said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; &ldquo;the
      nurse, then she's in the joke too?&rdquo; He glanced from one to the other. They
      all nodded. &ldquo;You're all in it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, flattered to think that they
      had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many of them to
      deceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Jimmy sadly, &ldquo;we are all 'in it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's a great actress,&rdquo; decided Alfred, with the air of a
      connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sure is,&rdquo; admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt
      his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him. &ldquo;She put up a phoney
      story about the kid being hers,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But I could tell she wasn't on
      the level. Good-night, sir,&rdquo; he called to Alfred, and ignoring Jimmy, he
      passed quickly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, officer,&rdquo; Alfred called after him. &ldquo;Hang around downstairs. I'll be
      down later and fix things up with you.&rdquo; Again Alfred gave his whole
      attention to his new-found family. He leaned over the cradle and gazed
      ecstatically into the three small faces below his. &ldquo;This is too much,&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too much,&rdquo; agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the couch
      in his customary attitude of gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right not to break it to me too suddenly,&rdquo; said Alfred, and with
      his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch by
      Jimmy's side. &ldquo;You're a cute one,&rdquo; he continued to Jimmy, who was edging
      away from the three mites with aversion. In the absence of any answer from
      Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, &ldquo;Isn't he a cute one, dear?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, VERY,&rdquo; answered Zoie, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at
      self restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you women are done with me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll clear out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear out?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself between
      his old friend and the door. &ldquo;What a chance,&rdquo; and he laughed boisterously.
      &ldquo;You're not going to get out of my sight this night,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I'm
      just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot
      where his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man needs someone around,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;when he's going through a
      thing like this. I need all of you, all of you,&rdquo; and with his eyes he
      embraced the weary circle of faces about him. &ldquo;I feel as though I could go
      out of my head,&rdquo; he explained and with that he began tucking the three
      small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You act as though you WERE out of your head,&rdquo; she commented, but Alfred
      did not heed her. He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
      three babies to sleep with one lullaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
      some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
      simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three, Alfred
      looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into the
      room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene. But
      Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry. She made directly for the
      side of Zoie's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you plaze, mum,&rdquo; she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Scuse me for comin' right in&rdquo;&mdash;Maggie was breathing hard&mdash;&ldquo;but
      me mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home
      from work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Sh!&rdquo; cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
      Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
      interest in Maggie's conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babies?&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;your father is mad about babies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, dear,&rdquo; interrupted Zoie nervously; &ldquo;you see,&rdquo; she went on
      to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, &ldquo;this is our
      washerwoman's little girl. Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it made
      the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
      easily disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, mum,&rdquo; she objected, &ldquo;it ain't about the wash. It's about
      our baby girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
      all his heirs were boys, &ldquo;No wonder your pa's angry. I'd be angry too.
      Come now,&rdquo; he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
      regarding her indulgently, &ldquo;you go straight home and tell your father that
      what HE needs is BOYS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, sir,&rdquo; answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
      Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
      parents, &ldquo;if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
      back,&rdquo; and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
      petticoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money?&rdquo; repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, &ldquo;what money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was again Zoie's time to think quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money for the wash, dear,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, &ldquo;who talks of
      money at such a time as this?&rdquo; And taking a ten dollar bill from his
      pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
      to return to him the original purchase money. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to the
      astonished girl, &ldquo;you take this to your father. Tell him I sent it to him
      for his babies. Tell him to start a bank account with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
      or at least, so Maggie decided. She had a hazy idea that Alfred was adding
      something to the original purchase price of her young sisters, but she was
      quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such a &ldquo;grand 'hoigh&rdquo;
       gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no doubt result in a
      beating when she reached home. She stared at Alfred undecided what to do,
      the money still lay in her outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her red
      little fingers over the bill, &ldquo;he's GOT to like it. He'll GROW to like it.
      Now you run along,&rdquo; he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her toward the
      door, &ldquo;and tell him what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
      under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
      backed chair. As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
      being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
      Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their way
      with him. His mind wandered toward other things and finally into space.
      His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing became
      laboured&mdash;so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
      Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it's Mr. Jinks!&rdquo; exclaimed Maggie. Then coming close to the side
      of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his ear.
      &ldquo;Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy sat up and rubbed his eyes. He studied the young person at his
      elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
      happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes. Apparently
      Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what? Jimmy thought
      he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes. Letting his hand fall over
      the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy began to make
      frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move. &ldquo;Shoo, shoo!&rdquo; he
      said, and waved her off with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
      Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father's mad at Jimmy?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the prompt
      answer that came from her direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wash, dear,&rdquo; said Zoie to Alfred; &ldquo;Jimmy had to go after the wash,&rdquo;
       and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
      stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, &ldquo;You needn't wait, Maggie; we
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an' it's more 'an I do,&rdquo; answered Maggie, and shaking her head
      sadly, she slipped from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
      Maggie's inhuman parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fancy,&rdquo; he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, &ldquo;fancy
      any man not liking to be the father of twins,&rdquo; and with that he again bent
      over the cradle and surveyed its contents. &ldquo;Think, Jimmy,&rdquo; he said, when
      he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, &ldquo;just think of the
      way THAT father feels, and then think of the way <i>I</i> feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then think of the way <i>I</i> feel,&rdquo; grumbled Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred; &ldquo;what have you to feel about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
      crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounded like breaking glass,&rdquo; said Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burglars!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burglars?&rdquo; repeated Alfred with a superior air; &ldquo;nonsense! Nonsense!
      Here,&rdquo; he said, turning to Jimmy, &ldquo;you hold the boys and I'll go see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust upon him, he
      felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his arms. He made
      what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff, strained attitude
      on the edge of the couch. In the meantime, Alfred had strode into the
      adjoining room with the air of a conqueror. Aggie looked at Zoie, with
      dreadful foreboding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't suppose it could be?&rdquo; she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My baby!&rdquo; shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
      room. &ldquo;Where IS he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy began
      to circle the room. So agitated was his mind that he could scarcely hear
      Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's come up the fire-escape,&rdquo; cried Aggie; &ldquo;she's beating Alfred to
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's locking him in the bathroom,&rdquo; declared Aggie, and with that she
      disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Alfred!&rdquo; cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find a
      satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and humanity.
      &ldquo;What shall I do with these things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat 'em,&rdquo; was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her negligee
      disappeared from the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
      commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which had
      been ringing violently for some minutes. As it was, he was wholly
      unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, plaze, sir,&rdquo; she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward the
      babes in Jimmy's arms, &ldquo;me fadder's coming right behind me. He's a-lookin'
      for you sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me,&rdquo; murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth seemed
      to be looking for HIM.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put 'em down, sir,&rdquo; cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
      &ldquo;put 'em down. He's liable to wallop you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put 'em where?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
      let the wobbly creatures down easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang went the outside door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Pa now,&rdquo; cried Maggie. &ldquo;Oh hide, sir, hide.&rdquo; And with that
      disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hide where?&rdquo; gasped Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's awful silence. Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
      cradle, his eyes sought the armchair. It had always betrayed him. He
      glanced toward the window. It was twelve stories to the pavement. He
      looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.
      His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made a
      determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
      through the door, than he drew it back quickly. The conversation between
      O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring. Jimmy decided to
      take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
      streaked it toward the opposite door. The shrieks and denunciations that
      he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of the Irish
      father. For an instant he stood in the centre of the room, wavering as to
      which side to surrender himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
      on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
      railing and the floor was far too narrow. Why had he disregarded Aggie's
      advice as to diet? The knob of the door handle was turning&mdash;he
      vaulted into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
      trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave go of me,&rdquo; cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a vain
      effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
      beneath the covers, &ldquo;there you are, mum,&rdquo; and he shook his fist above what
      he believed to be the cowardly Mrs. Hardy. &ldquo;'Tis well ye may cover up your
      head,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for shame on yez! Me wife may take in washing, but when I
      comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin' 'em too.
      Where ar' they?&rdquo; he demanded. Then getting no response from the agitated
      covers, he glanced wildly about the room. &ldquo;Glory be to God!&rdquo; he exclaimed
      as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in astonishment, when
      upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but three &ldquo;barren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're child stalers, that's what they are,&rdquo; he declared to Maggie, as
      he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast. &ldquo;Me
      little Biddy,&rdquo; he crooned over his much coveted possession. &ldquo;Me little
      Norah,&rdquo; he added fondly, looking down at his second. The thought of his
      narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled his
      wrath. Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
      semi-quiet comforter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black heart of ye, mum,&rdquo; he roared, then ordering Maggie to give back
      &ldquo;every penny of that shameless creetur's money&rdquo; he turned toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in his
      denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman rushing
      toward him from the opposite door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, you!&rdquo; cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment, she
      laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced her.
      &ldquo;Where are you going with my baby?&rdquo; she asked, then peering into the face
      of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed moan. &ldquo;'Tis not
      my baby!&rdquo; she cried. She scanned the face of the second infant&mdash;again
      she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
      of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
      cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there,&rdquo; he said. Then
      bidding Maggie to &ldquo;git along out o' this&rdquo; and shrugging his shoulders to
      convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
      quickly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
      the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
      Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, you!&rdquo; called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother. &ldquo;How dare
      you lock my husband in the bathroom?&rdquo; She pointed to the key, which the
      woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand. &ldquo;Give me that key,&rdquo; she
      demanded, &ldquo;give it to me this instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your horrid old key,&rdquo; said the mother, and she threw it on the
      floor. &ldquo;If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
      JAIL,&rdquo; and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
      her welcome departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
      just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go to
      the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
      bathroom door and demanding his instant release.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let him out,&rdquo; said Aggie. &ldquo;You get into bed,&rdquo; and she slipped
      quickly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet and
      slipped beneath it. Her first sensation was of touching something rough
      and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing against which
      she lay was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited bed-fellow,
      or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room emitting a
      series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that direction
      seem mere baby cries. So completely had Jimmy been enveloped in the
      coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague feeling of
      aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all knowledge of
      their goings and comings. But when his unexpected companion was thrust
      upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream, and swathed
      in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the upper side of
      the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed, awaiting further
      developments. Of one thing he was certain, a great deal had transpired
      since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and he had no mind
      to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter. By the time he had
      summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a babel of voices
      was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his shell and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie before
      her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
      the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
      Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You imagined it, Zoie,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;look for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps I did,&rdquo; she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
      room, &ldquo;my nerves are jumping like fizzy water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were soon to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
      anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered the
      room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who had
      dared to make him a captive in his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
      about the room. Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly acquired
      offspring. &ldquo;My boys!&rdquo; he cried, and he rushed toward the crib. &ldquo;They're
      gone!&rdquo; he declared tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; echoed Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ALL of them,&rdquo; said Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All,&rdquo; insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.
      &ldquo;She's taken them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way. They had a hazy
      recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman, but
      what had become of the other two?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo; asked Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that night,
      &ldquo;I left them with Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; he snorted, with sudden comprehension, &ldquo;then he's at it again.
      He's crazy as she is. This is inhuman. This joke has got to stop!&rdquo; And
      with that decision he started toward the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Allie!&rdquo; protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and patted
      her shoulder condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Control yourself, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Control yourself; I'll get your
      babies for you&mdash;trust me, I'll get them. And then,&rdquo; he added with
      parting emphasis from the doorway, &ldquo;I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie were
      engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room. By
      uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
      for him immediately upon his reappearance. He determined not to wait for
      the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was well
      covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the bedroom
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
      beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
      wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful creature
      now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting into Aggie's
      outstretched arms.

      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie was
      bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred returned
      in triumph. He was followed by the officer in whose arms were three
      infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical Italian
      woman, and last of all, Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them all in here, officer,&rdquo; called Alfred over his shoulder. &ldquo;I'll
      soon prove to you whose babies those are.&rdquo; Then turning to Aggie, who
      stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly, &ldquo;I've got
      them Aggie, I've got them.&rdquo; He glanced toward the empty bed. &ldquo;Where's
      Zoie?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's fainted,&rdquo; said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young wife,
      she pointed toward the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling!&rdquo; cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie and
      began frantically patting her hands. &ldquo;My poor frightened darling!&rdquo; Then he
      turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within him, &ldquo;You
      see what these people have done to my wife? She's fainted.&rdquo; Ignoring the
      uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over Zoie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse yourself, my dear,&rdquo; he begged of her. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he pleaded.
      &ldquo;Your babies are safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HER babies!&rdquo; snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let you know when I want to hear from you,&rdquo; snarled the officer to
      O'Flarety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're NOT her babies,&rdquo; protested the Italian woman desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it,&rdquo; shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
      parents were obliged to bide their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
      regained her senses. &ldquo;Your babies are all right,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I've
      brought them all back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All?&rdquo; gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
      intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Alfred, &ldquo;every one,&rdquo; and he pointed toward the three
      infants in the officer's arms. &ldquo;See, dear, see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
       she moaned and again she swooned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you she'd be afraid to face us,&rdquo; shouted the now triumphant
      O'Flarety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brute!&rdquo; retorted the still credulous Alfred, &ldquo;how dare you persecute
      this poor demented mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
      Italian woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't persecute me, oh no!&rdquo; she exclaimed sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still, you!&rdquo; commanded the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and begged
      her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's hear her SAY it,&rdquo; demanded O'Flarety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You SHALL hear her,&rdquo; answered Alfred, with confidence. Then he beckoned
      to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
      Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Zoie!&rdquo; pleaded Alfred. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them away!&rdquo; she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, &ldquo;take them
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; shouted O'Flarety. This hateful reminder brought
      Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The excitement has unnerved her,&rdquo; he said to the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you about done with my kids?&rdquo; asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
      man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
      &ldquo;good payin' job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want for your proof anyway?&rdquo; asked the mother. But Alfred's
      faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
      shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife is in no condition to be questioned,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;She's out of
      her head, and if you don't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
      second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,&rdquo; he
      called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Joker!&rdquo; cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
      ferocious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught him slipping down the fire-escape,&rdquo; explained the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again?&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes upon
      him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast failing
      faculties, &ldquo;you know the truth of this thing. You are the one who sent me
      that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, aren't you a father?&rdquo; asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
      spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; replied Alfred, with every confidence, &ldquo;but I have to
      prove it to the officer. Jimmy knows,&rdquo; he concluded. Then turning to the
      uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, &ldquo;Tell the officer
      the truth, you idiot. No more of your jokes. Am I a father or am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're depending on ME for your future offspring,&rdquo; answered Jimmy,
      wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, &ldquo;you are
      NOT a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depending on YOU?&rdquo; gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
      bewilderment. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask them,&rdquo; answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred appealed to Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Zoie,&rdquo; said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie. &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he
      entreated, &ldquo;rouse yourself.&rdquo; Slowly she opened her eyes. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said
      Alfred, with enforced self-control, &ldquo;you must look the officer squarely in
      the eye and tell him whose babies those are,&rdquo; and he nodded toward the
      officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should <i>I</i> know?&rdquo; cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only borrowed them,&rdquo; said Zoie, &ldquo;to get you home,&rdquo; and with that she
      sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; cried the triumphant O'Flarety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they're your'n all right,&rdquo; admitted the officer doggedly, and he
      grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they'd better be,&rdquo; shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
      woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; cried Alfred. &ldquo;I want an understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; added the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your way,&rdquo; commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
      with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfred gazed about the room. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed; then he turned to
      Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: &ldquo;If I'm not a
      father, what am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd hate to tell you,&rdquo; was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
      dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do with this one, sir?&rdquo; asked the officer, undecided as to
      Jimmy's exact standing in the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot him, for all I care,&rdquo; groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ungrateful!&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of your funny business,&rdquo; said the officer with a parting nod at
      Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
      that Jimmy had left on his shins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy!&rdquo; said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
      against his round apoplectic cheek. &ldquo;You poor dear! And after all you have
      done for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to her
      feet, &ldquo;he's done a lot, hasn't he?&rdquo; And then forgetting that her original
      adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous results was
      still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly, &ldquo;All this would
      never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his horrid old
      luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was startled. This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
      well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life. He
      turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luncheon?&rdquo; exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
      now beginning to sit up and take notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luncheon?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make a
      clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
      ingratiating manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Alfred,&rdquo; she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about his
      unsuspecting neck, &ldquo;if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL TRUTH.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and a
      determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
      interrupted Zoie's narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred the
      real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another day,
      she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment was
      evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices, up and
      down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter of golden
      curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his ample, well kept
      grounds.

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
